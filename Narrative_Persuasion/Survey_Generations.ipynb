      "While there have been some gains made in Afghanistan, there are still many challenges that will exist even if the US pulls out. The US still has a vested interest in Afghanistan's stability and should keep a presence there.\n",

      "The war in Afghanistan has gone on for 14 years. However, the Taliban is still a threat in the country and a terrorist organization. Keeping troops in the country is necessary to prevent further terrorist attacks in the United States.\n",
      "China and Iran are both trying to fill the power vacuum left after the United States' retreat from Afghanistan. The United States must remain to prevent China and Iran from gaining a foothold in the region.\n",
      "The administration plans to keep troops in Afghanistan until 2024 to continue fighting terrorists.\n",
      "Afghanistan is famously known as “the graveyard of empires” because past empires all failed to defeat its people. ISIS has taken over areas of Afghanistan and threaten the citizens there. The United States should not let ISIS take over Afghanistan and allow it to remain a breeding ground for terrorists.\n",
      "The Taliban are growing stronger in Afghanistan and are gaining territory. If the Taliban regain power, they will push back women’s rights and force men and women to go back to wearing burqas.\n",

      "There is no doubt that the Taliban poses a threat to American military personnel. The Taliban has killed far too many American military personnel from attacks from the ground. That is why we should keep troops in Afghanistan indefinitely to defeat the Taliban.\n",
      "At the end of the day, too many American troops in Afghanistan increase the risk of escalating the conflict. However, a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan also would increase the risk for a return to Taliban control. So, keep American troops in Afghanistan until a functional government is established. Then, reduce American military interventions.\n",
      "Afghanistan is still a hotbed for terrorism, and the Taliban is making a comeback. The United States needs to keep troops in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future to prevent terrorism from spreading throughout the world.\n",
      "Afghanistan is a strategically important country but it also has a large heroin and opium trade. The Taliban is getting stronger and it would not be prudent to pull out of Afghanistan completely.\n",
      "While we were in Afghanistan we were able to prevent al-Qaeda from regaining a foothold in the country. We should continue to fight against al-Qaeda and the terrorists in Afghanistan.\n",
      "The United States is at war with terrorists and needs to keep troops in Afghanistan as long as necessary to prevent the terrorists from gaining control of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the United States should encourage Afghanistan to form a more representative government, which will be more likely to succeed if the United States retains its military presence in the country.\n",
      "Afghanistan is an ally for the United States. However, we have lost the support of the people of the country. It is time to bring our troops home.\n",
      "The United States is engaged in a war against terrorism. Certain terrorist organizations have taken root in Afghanistan. The United States should keep troops in Afghanistan to continue the war and to keep the terrorists from returning to Afghanistan.\n",
      "Afghanistan is a country in central Asia that has been almost continually at war with itself and its neighbors for centuries. Afghanistan has been the victim of foreign interference since the 19th century. Now the United States is in Afghanistan on a mission to make the country a safer place for its citizens.\n",
      "The United States should keep troops in Afghanistan to prevent terrorism from returning to the country.\n",
