CONTEXT

The most serious consequences of the 20th century's global climate crisis are not only the alarming increases in land-use change, but also related changes to demand for resources and higher levels of poverty. More than half a century on, the record-breaking affluence of Asian economies in many key parts of the world has been met with an increase in mechanization and logistics, as well as increasingly unaffordable housing, home demolition, and waste management. One way to counter the growing burden is increased inter-country competition, and sustainable access to resources, including civil-owned enterprises. This has made competing for global natural resources and international markets difficult. China has been forced to extend its military and economic support to key allies on the outflow of resources, either from US military bases or taken by low-cost aircraft from countries including India, Japan, and Pakistan. For decades, financial and economic sanctions and Chinese efforts to facilitate trade has played an important role in consolidating a free-market system of free trade, free trade policy, and open markets. These pro-regulatory measures and actions, however, have also made a negative impact on communities and economies and challenged China's international leadership.

Fundamentally, the 20th century marked the first significant development of the economic base-building toolkit in China; beginning with the Economic Growth, Investment, Industrialization, and Green Revolution (GII) from 1920 to 1930, it is evident that the 19th century's richest capitalist republics of the world, such as the US, much of India, Southeast Asia, and South-East Asia, continue to compete for resources. These rich nations increasingly increase their investment in foreign resources (from oil, coal, iron, and other coal-ore energy), as well as technological advances and increasing social solidarity.

Agriculture continues to be the main source of economic and technological
","Photo: VCGWhile the talks are going smoothly, some critics have called for the US to rethink the attitude on the ASEAN Economic Council for potential protectionism and deepen pressure on Chinese businesses. However, from the perspective of the majority of Chinese people, no such considerations are rational and diplomatic efforts should not be put in such a way, as it would cut the Chinese economy into three sectors, media reports said.In recent days, however, the chances of the two sides concluding a consensus on the trade status are virtually slim, Jiang Weijun, director of the Institute of World Economic Outlook at Shenzhen Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday. ""This is not something the US has done and should not back down.""While the US hasn't yet pulled the trigger on its decision to strike a new trade deal with China, China and the US have been actively negotiating on the basis of strengthening mutual respect and mutual respect, and setting the parameters in order to achieve the phase one target, said Jiang, adding that the US also needs to keep a low profile on the China-US trade deficit.Weiwen told the Global Times that bilateral consultations were initiated by Chinese President Xi Jinping and head of the China-India Economic Corridor Silk Road (SIFT) taskforce Ajit Doval that, if the meeting goes ahead, China and India would really be on the list. ""This is the beginning of negotiations, and the US does not want to have any tangible mechanism to stoke up the trade tension, so we'll continue negotiations with the US,"" Weiwen said.China is pursuing economic autonomy, reform and opening-up, with its ""balance sheet"" and other common attributes, US officials have said, saying the US is weighing China's trade with the rest of the world as an indispensable part of its long-term development, a violation of China's sovereignty and international influence. ""The US has two key drivers in the economic globalization of the Asian
","The Chinese regime ’s persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China continues unabated, human rights experts say.  The Falun Dafa Information Center in Shandong Province, an independent research center, published a survey of 1,200 Chinese residents from about 50 communities across the country. The results show that while 20 percent said they practiced Falun Gong, the remaining 49 percent in many areas blamed it for “unfounded persecution”.  Around 70 percent said they did not believe in the Falun Gong practice, which is punishable by death for having non-conforming beliefs.  Nearly two-thirds, 73 percent, and 92 percent of respondents said they were undecided. Only about six percent said they were not sure, and about nine percent did not answer the question.  “In a time of increasing hate crimes and a deeply divided society, people’s minds tend to grow more reluctant to take up positions of authority,” said David Weiser, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, an Washington-based think tank. “Although we rarely hear about this mass persecution happening in China, it is still happening.”  Falun Dafa, a meditation practice originally practiced by the ancient Chinese civilization in the ancient city of Piato that, like meditation practice in China, was heavily persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the Cultural Revolution of 1976-1980. Over the next decade, thousands were detained, tortured, and executed.  According to Chinese estimates, Falun Gong practitioners were over one million to one million.  According to the Pew Research Center, Falun Gong was one of the most heavily persecuted spiritual practice groups in China until 2016 when the CCP launched a massive persecution, forced organ harvesting, and persecution of adherents in Hong Kong.  In 2014, the regime declared Falun Dafa a “genocide” under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
","BEIJING -- The spiritual leader of China's spiritual questing party, the Miao Jizhu, has been formally introduced to Parliament on Wednesday for a second term as Communist Party member, the Communist Party said on Thursday.Mr. Gao is a strongman who leads various levels of government, sometimes as prime minister, and his family members often sit at the apex of power, in many areas of Beijing. Many in the party view him as a pragmatic leader with deep intellectual trust.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Military Captures in Thailand Anniversary::The disappearance of a former Thai Air Force fighter jet has cast deep shadow over the ongoing battle to free about 1,000 men suspected of hijacking Chinese military jets, Chinese security forces and Vietnamese forces, who flew on tour in Thailand last month. The former Thai military pilot Terry Novak, who disappeared on June 30, is believed to have been on the Mekong Delta, in the southern province of Phuket, when a group of unidentified people hijacked a Thai Air Force fighter jet on June 28, sending it spiraling into flames and sinking it into the sea. The jet was the second successful hijacking of a Chinese plane this year, the authorities said in a statement released on Friday, while the Thai military said the men had been drinking wine aboard the jet. The statement did not name Mr. Novak's destination.After an investigation, the Thai military said the men were being held in administrative detention on the charge that he committed ''destruction of state secrets,'' the state news agency Vostok said on Wednesday, citing the Ministry of National Defense. The statement was later deleted from a website running on the government's Web site.The last known man still missing from the previous July tour was a self-taught cleric who traveled with the Malaysian Navy, the Thai government and the country's South Asian allies in Southeast Asia to Turkey, where he used a boarding pass to
","KOLKATA: The chairman of Karnataka Railways (KR&) Railways on Wednesday said that there are serious concerns among the passengers and the cargo, especially in the Kolkata-Guwahati and Pulwama corridor areas, concerning operational issues of various levels and passenger compartments along the LAC. Speaking to the Lok Sabha at Ujjain Town, Kozhikode chairman of Karnataka R& had said that because of poor health, many persons have a low tolerance for incursions, which is why they have decided to refrain from flying in the area in spite of a high compliance rate.R& had raised many issues such as low pollution and shutters for loading, unloading and unloading of cargo across the LAC. ""It's about design, construction, operational situation of trains and they should perform better in the areas between the areas. Hence there are serious concerns among the passengers and the cargo, especially in the Kolkata-Guwahati and Pulwama corridor areas,"" he had said.The chairman added that the body has also asked the concerned parties to review the proposed actions and plans of the railway, plan line and operational control measures by R& to ensure operating efficiency and prompt corrective actions by the rail companies as per the Union Railways Working Group, which was meeting in London in September 2013.R& had emphasized on the need to know operational problems along the LAC and train service disruptions during rush hours and also discuss mechanism for promoting and maintaining long distance railway service and improving efficiency of the existing Line and Equipment Design (LAD) within certain parameters for improvement of the quality of train and management system. ""They should know how to properly optimize vehicles, specialised systems and implement the infrastructure in such a way that improvement of train operations can be achieved in case of any issues. Along the LAC, the entire series of stalled systems can be fixed by receiving reprieve passes from drivers during the peak hours of the day
","While the US and its allies have begun their five-year hard fought confrontation over the disputed Himalayan border - a cornerstone of their relationship - the US and China remain not friends in a political sense.Still, the two sides are finding it helpful to close ranks to coordinate operations, both of which are meant to benefit each other. The National Security Council has made at least two rounds of calls in the past year, including on Tibet in April.“It’s been many years since all of the civilisations, religions and races were born. All ethnic groups were related in a very fundamental way, and were treated fairly.”In 2008, two years after the city's independence, the council invited China to attend a meeting on the Tibet issue. The US remained on board, and they were required to agree on a peaceful resolution by October 1.The US military retreated from the border two years later, despite expressing some reservations about China becoming too assertive.Arguably, there were plenty of opportunities for American strategists to deal with the issue in more objective terms. To those with an interest in geopolitics, Chinese and American analysts have sought out key areas of agreement and cooperation, including working together with their adversaries in anti-graft diplomacy and counterterrorism.The Trump administration, for instance, sought to quash the Iran nuclear deal in late February, seizing on its position that Beijing was giving Tehran a green light to buy a more powerful atomic weapon, and engaged with Beijing to try to stave off Chinese competitor's deployment of an advanced naval missile. The White House also  reinforced its position on an important economic corridor, the southern oil hub of the Southeast Asian nation, with the campaign to convince Chinese leaders that they could properly use subsidies to plug their shipping lanes to trade with the United States.The clash in the Himalayan have strained ties, but as a direct result, peace has remained elusive for at least a decade. Their key drivers of distrust are the politics and the

","The World Trade Organization (WTO) announced a new calculation in an unusual move aimed at avoiding tariffs on Chinese goods on Aug. 11, as Beijing rejected a proposal from countries including India to scrap a ban on Chinese goods on their shelves.In its latest move, the WTO said that the adoption of Beijing's plan would put American products on the same side as Chinese goods, hinting that the American industry in Beijing may have been right to respond.The United States had pushed Beijing to adopt a tougher trading policy against Chinese imports, which included a tariff of 30 percent on Chinese goods in 2018 and 25 percent in 2020. But China's cabinet-like National People's Congress (NPC) has postponed its meeting scheduled for Sept. 5 to address the issue, amidst escalating trade tensions. The timing of the NPC meeting makes it unlikely that a trade deal will be reached immediately, WTO officials said.U.S. President Donald Trump has ruled out dealing with Beijing on the issue, even as he promised his cabinet-like government to avoid any retaliation.""Instead of considering tariffs on Chinese goods, the WTO should start working to improve standards for Chinese goods and stop the diversion of U.S. jobs, equipment and labor,"" Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross told reporters on Aug. 11.Earlier on Aug. 12, China, Southeast Asian countries, and Taiwan criticized WTO leaders for ignoring its demands and Beijing's ""agreed settlement"" with India's complaints, making the deadline for all WTO members to meet in mid-September less than seven months since June last year.""Failure to honor the  commitment of the bilateral economic dialogue must be reversed,"" Taiwan and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Republic of Korea, and China have joined their regional counterparts in condemning the WTO's ""concentration camp.""

","BEIJING -- Trade disputes in China are a natural part of global economic debate, not a problem facing the United States or Japan. That fact must be worried about the Chinese Communist Party leadership, which has accused the ruling party of bribing foreign companies to work for it. It may be that the trade war has not caused a reaction on the part of Chinese leaders, but the looming Chinese national holiday over the weekend may have produced some lopsided feedback.The biggest news on Sunday morning was that President Xi Jinpingof China, hailed as a hero by Beijing, declared that there was a ''positive side'' to trade and ''substantial impact'' on domestic and foreign companies. That attitude was on full display, with Mr. Xi issuing a statement that prompted a full-throated discussion about the repercussions on Chinese businesses and on the possibility of ''collective action'' by Washington.He also cautioned against the possibility of strengthening trade relations with South Korea and other Asian countries to further enliven up relations between the countries.On the trade front, Mr. Xi also promised a free trade agreement with China in the coming months. The Chinese leader also said that the United States, the world's second-largest economy, must ''think carefully'' and agree to the terms of such an agreement in order to benefit Chinese companies that sell products to the United States.That message was reminiscent of a statement he made on Saturday in Shanghai that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un,who came to power in late 2013 and has since renounced all North Korea and accepted the idea of sending nuclear weapons to the country, was an important economic warning, just days before North Korea's fourth nuclear test.The warning drew a huge reaction on social media. Some called for the United States to withdraw from trade talks with Pyongyang and trade with the entire North Korean regime under President Trump. Some said that the entire Chinese economy should leave the South Korea economy.Another message was that people should remain vigilant about the effects on

The lawsuit was lodged against a city government body, Hong Kong Grand Prix (based in Zhejiang province), after pro-democracy campaigners protested and demanded the city hall closed down.The lawsuit was also filed against the chief of police in a high-level investigation into the rise of anti-government demonstrations and their organizers, including students and teachers.The Beijing Municipal People's Court declared the investigation of the protest, organized by pro-democracy campaigners, to be complete in November 2014, the day the director general of police declared martial law and placed the five persons being investigated on trial.Beijing's official media described the lawsuit as a publicity stunt aimed at diverting attention from the protests.

International trade rose at the fastest pace in three months in August, as China made moves to further cut tariffs, partly in response to Canada's efforts to lift shipments and reduce reliance on imports.The World Trade Organisation has previously said it would reach a trade deal with Canada within two months, but has now made no further moves to reach one, according to a statement from Beijing.On its website, the WTO said: ""This process has started. From now on, no preconditions can be met for the final agreement to be reached, and it is understood that Canada will stay until the next important stage [when the US] reaches a meaningful... agreement.""Wednesday's action comes amid growing tension between the two sides over territorial disputes in the South China Sea and about the trade war. Last week, the US claimed it had built a ""sea wall"" around disputed Spratly Islands in the East China Sea, claiming some of the islands were part of its exclusive economic zone.Earlier this month, the US accused China of sinking an aircraft carrier while it flew close to the contested waters, claiming that it was only following its territorial claims to allow ""aggressively hostile movements of a destructive nature"".China has repeatedly denied this accusation, citing the testimony of a Chinese government official, and called the accusations unfounded. The US's accusation was confirmed by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which found that China and the Philippines had ""reasonable grounds"" for a preliminary phase-in of the negotiations.The decision was made at a hearing yesterday, without a full explanation by the US, which confirmed the tribunal's ruling.Amid growing trade tensions, the US has voiced concern that China could use its rising clout in the trade talks with Canada and the

6,Bilateral FTAs can be Beijing's opportunity in new era of multipolar trade world,"China and Central American countries signed a free trade agreement (FTA) in the capital of Costa Rica on Friday, marking the first such deal for China in the Latin American region.

A total of 14 countries from the region, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama, signed the agreement with China.

""In a new era of multipolar trade world, China will sign more bilateral FTAs to deepen economic and trade cooperation with more partners, creating a new pattern for win-win cooperation,"" said Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce and former deputy director of the State Council's Development Research Center.

A list of major planned bilateral FTAs for China is as follows: Australia and New Zealand (ChAFTA), India (FTA), South Korea (FTA), Japan (FTA), ASEAN countries (ECA), Latin America (FTA) and Russia (EEA).

In the next 10 years, China will continue to promote regional cooperation and free trade agreements. The Belt and Road Initiative will be an important example.

In addition, China will further enhance economic cooperation with neighboring countries under the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which will play an important role in promoting regional stability and development.

Thanks to its fast development, China has become the world's largest trader in goods, with its foreign trade volume reaching more than $5 trillion in 2017. The steady growth rate is expected to continue while its foreign trade surplus is expected to continue shrinking year by year.

China's imports from South Korea hit a record high in 2017 despite the United States' threat to impose tariffs on South Korean imports because of Seoul's deployment of a US anti-missile system. The value of imports from the US was $42 billion last year. Imports from Japan reached $133 billion, accounting for 12 percent of its total imports. Imports from Germany totaled $116 billion last year, accounting","China's Global Trade Bank chairman Xi Jinping had suggested the World Trade Organisation reach a common strategy on trade agreements when it formally introduced the World Trade Centre in 2015. That agreement, under which the United States, Japan and South Korea will have a massive amount of trade control over the global economy, will be something of an exception to Beijing's new directions on trade at the moment. Although Chinese leaders have sounded weary of the notion, right now China is attracting a wide range of players, with a plan to take its overall trade position further, enabling it to move away from its earlier complacency in the Asia-Pacific region. Beijing is expected to revisit its post-1998 trade deal with the US in the coming months, and may expand on the club it had in the past. The China World Trade Organisation, especially China Shanghai, a trade body, is largely composed of representatives of each of China's listed countries, and some of them might push for changes to the bilateral trade policy of each member State and to its own monetary policy.

For the first time, China has a World Trade Organization (WTO) working group to represent 100 countries. The newly appointed chairman of the ROC hopes to codify fundamental principles as well as principles of the international body, where both companies and individuals, like businesses, are welcome.

Liu Jianxian, deputy head of the Shanghai International Institute of Commerce's China-Japan Technical Bank and chief executive officer of WTI in China, said the main aim of the TSO is to ""exclude the communist republics of Central Asia and Asia from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). To do so, the WTO could become a way for regional blocs to become part of the world market."" So far, a group of six nations in the US, Australia, China, Malaysia, India, Russia, Norway, Switzerland, South Korea and the Netherlands has signed on to the plan. WTI and the

The China-US trade war may be coming to an end, but as the world economy remains in a two-way headlock, that doesn't mean Trump's win in the US elections is now a dead end for Beijing.Beijing is beginning to move forward its transition away from the Soviet Union and into a new era of economic rejuvenation. This was also the theme of last year's US presidential election. And since the sudden death of economic advisor Stephen Schwarzman last month, the country has declared its readiness to change policy.Given its small population and high population density, the increase in China's trade volume should not come as a surprise to most US observers.

He added that the decision was made following consultation with civil society, law enforcement, and regulatory bodies.""Beijing has the right to seek fair, enforceable, and comprehensive rights under international law, including civil liberties and fundamental freedoms,"" Wang said. ""China should recognize and strictly enforce the right of its citizens to equality under law and the rule of law.""China's ruling communist regime has responded by banning Western companies from operating in China, and imposing sanctions on companies involved in illegal activities in order to force the Chinese regime to release those involved.The Chinese regime has enacted tough trade policies to punish its critics, such as intellectual property theft, land theft, and subsidies. The Chinese regime has also been moving aggressively to develop its labor market through the mass-produced-fabrication of robots, often to find cheap labor in the manufacturing of Chinese goods.For example, in 2016, China developed 10 million high-tech robots at its factory in Hubei Province; 40,000 of them were manufactured in China and domestically.In November 2018, in China, Chinese competitor Guangdong Technology Industry Technology Corporation (GREECech) suddenly removed six of its robots from their factory, citing safety concerns about its management practices.GREECech denied this allegation, saying that the automaker violated WTO rules when it illegally marketed its products to consumer groups in China.GREECech also said that its factories were rigged and would not release ""robots"" that were being shipped by courier.The two-page report, titled ""On the Global

As a result, the list is frequently censored online.The document released by China's civil liberties commission on Wednesday included on its Web site about six countries that had joined the blacklist, including Belarus, Kazakhstan, Iraq, Myanmar, Iran, Russia, South Korea and the People's Republic of China. Among the countries included in the list, Iran and Russia are illegal ''companies of statecraft,'' as its financial and economic sanctions and illegal search policies place it on a blacklist.Some of the more prominent are China's Abstinence Warehouse Group, which controls ZTE, China's largest telecom giant, as well as Taiwan, Zimbabwe and Bhutan.''This list of blocked websites is used by China to censor others, where they influence the growth, development and rules of economic activity in China,'' said Ilham Tohti, a human rights lawyer based in New York. ''People who are considered engaged in economic activities in China are doing it on the basis of the plan and doctrine of the Chinese Communist Party that the state is to serve as a 'external influence.'

Chinese leaders have sounded the alarm about the threat that FTA poses to China because of the tendency of many countries to adhere to rules and regulations, which are designed to shift their economies away from emerging markets.""Traditionally, the trilateral has been a ladder, starting from Shanghai and ending at Bali,"" he said. ""Tribunal rules and regulations, the ultimate goal of trilateral relations is to maintain a stable and stable system of international order.""The ministry responded by citing history and tradition. ""Trilateral ties are forged by strengthening friendship and cooperation between different members of the global community, who form a solidarity which compels each other to develop trade and development cooperation,"" Geng said. ""Traditionally, countries like Australia and New Zealand have achieved great success in developing trilateral cooperation. The ties between the two nations become more important to us because of the harmony and mutual respect among countries as a whole and for our peoples,"" he said.The official statement also criticized regional leaders for reacting negatively to unilateral actions by ""aggressively pursuing regional stability"", and referring to the ongoing Brazil-India economic boundary dispute.""There is no room for gradual change and for reliance on the existing order and consensus that emerges from history,"" it said. ""Tribal affairs are of vital importance to our common interests, upholding all norms of international law and not using unilateral force,"" the statement added.In recent weeks, regional leaders from Russia, Ukraine, Brunei, Australia and US expressed hope that a trade treaty breaking down could facilitate the South China Sea dispute resolution through negotiations instead of resorting to aggressive action and provocative

7,"China could promote closer collaboration with Japan, S.Korea to prompt N.Korea's economic push","China could promote closer collaboration with Japan and South Korea to prompt North Korea's economic opening and reforms, a Chinese state media article said on Wednesday, pointing out that Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes were stifling its neighbour's economic development.

North Korea is under heavy sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council for its missile and nuclear tests.

China is the isolated North's traditional ally and its largest trading partner. It has in the past resisted pressuring North Korea due to fears of destabilising an already fragile country.

But it has shown growing frustration with Pyongyang in recent months, including supporting a U.N. Security Council ban on North Korean exports in August and criticising its latest missile launches.

An article in the state-run Global Times described the international sanctions against North Korea as ""the price Pyongyang has to pay for its diplomatic provocations"".

""Pyongyang should be clear that as long as it continues with its nuclear and missile programmes, it will only face further economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation,"" it said.

""If Pyongyang is committed to giving up nuclear weapons development, it should speed up domestic reforms to improve its economy,"" it added. ""Pyongyang should not miss the opportunity given by Beijing.""

The article was published after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met his Japanese counterpart Taro Kono in Beijing on Tuesday, where they agreed to work together for a peaceful resolution of tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

""China is North Korea's key ally and biggest trading partner ... (but) China advocates resolving the issue through diplomatic means ... and has been frustrated by Pyongyang's nuclear programme,"" Kyodo News quoted Kono as saying.","15th anniversary of the 1945 Japanese occupation

1945 invaded Japan and took over much of South East Asia

The AIIB divided and created a tiny, small Communist Party

One day, the President of the Communist Party of Japan, Koichi Abe was elected President of the Society of World Economists as a reaction to the Japanese occupation. Abe's reformist reformist policy saw the unification of Central and South East Asia into separate political countries. The elimination of Japanese independence was a popular message for the international community. In June 1945, Abe visited South Korea to join the World Economic Forum. On 13 June, he made a speech calling for the re-establishment of the armistice with Japan.

The Japanese Bureaus, the democratic East Asian democracies to which the Bureaus have never remade a following of 40 million in history, began accepting Japanese citizens and there were some sympathetic Americans and some illegal immigrants for border adjustment. In 1946, S.Korea applied for acceptance in order to avoid any special deal with the North.

The Convention on Korean Human Rights enshrined Japan's responsibilities under the 1951 Munich Accords, which, as with every other Cold War treaty, barred major independent states from including friendly Korean members and imposed strict pro-kindergarten requirements for that, but the extent to which their amendments included vague obligations based on territorial sovereignty and direct conquest.

By December of 1946, after Abe's declaration of national independence, Japan's representation in Japan from the Day of Departure and of the Rise of the Republics was 0.01 percent (more than one-third of its delegation and two-thirds of its ministers from all countries). It finally came back. According to press reports, in June 1946, around 1,000 million residents of the entire country were moved to their own community.

The ""Japanese decision"" that the South Korea and Japan should build two World Economic Forum meetings is a blatant and provocative
","While the US and Japan have been establishing close ties and bargaining chips, making it hard for them to reach a breakthrough on the AIIB issue, China is expressing its firm support for its AIIB initiatives.China has increased efforts to advance the close cooperation between China and the two countries and has been actively encouraging financial and trade cooperation between them, as Japan has cut ties with Japan, in many fields such as services, and has shown more sincerity toward the Japanese side on the Japanese issue.This shows China's sincerity, openness and determination for AIIB, and Chinese capital's enthusiasm for playing the role.The two sides have made preparations for a possible THAAD deployment by the end of 2016. From the perspective of China, BAE and Russia are preparing to give up on the design of the THAAD deployment by the end of this year, and US military officials are actively planning to pursue their planned deployment of the THAAD base in Japan to take place in early 2017, which will target the North Korean nuclear issue.Many strategic scholars believe that the THAAD deployment would bolster China's determination to persist in containing Pyongyang. China should offer a clear, stable and wise response, avoiding anxiety and headwinds in diplomatic negotiations, as well as help Japan cope with a crisis related to the South China Sea issue. There are 3D simulations showing that the deployment will not lead to direct conflict in the South China Sea. As China has given the deadline for all parties to acknowledge the deployment in advance, Chinese concrete support for it will be strengthened and it can be realized. The US will no longer use economic pressure and pressure on China, and the Trump administration should adopt its actual actions to show its goodwill toward AIIB negotiations.The author is director of the Institute of International Relations at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn Follow us on Twitter @GTopinionIn Asia::China is a major trading partner

","KOREA — The prospect of talks between a nation that regards itself as China’s defender of the South China Sea as important, and who for years has shown a fealty to the United States, is a high-stakes negotiation — but is beginning to weigh heavily on both sides of the Pacific.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe of Japan, said at a meeting in Hawaii that in many respects the two sides “respect each other” and that both “have started working very closely together.” Mr. Abe’s remarks, made in a state news conference in Singapore on Friday, were designed to show that despite disagreements, the two sides are enjoying a constructive development of the relationship.The tense Pacific exchange began Monday when two warships — the Liaoning and the Poseidon — sailed near Japan’s southern islands, prompting questions from Japan’s minister of defense, Itsunori Onodera, about whether the two navies had fully cooperated in sea and air patrols or if the first plane had made its way in from a patrol boat on a collision course with the second. The Chinese and Japanese navies did not appear to agree on whether Japan, at a news conference on Friday, had officially blocked the second aircraft, and in a sign of where both countries stand on the area, Mr. Onodera denied that the Liaoning had reached the disputed areas.It was not clear how swiftly China, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan and Japan’s militaries arrived at their own island on Friday, but it was likely that the air patrols and the patrols would be going out at roughly the same time.The meeting appeared to mark the end of a long progress on the contentious issue of territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Mr. Abe faced fierce opposition from some leaders in both nations.Under the latest agreement, the Chinese and Japanese navies would jointly establish “right to navigation” zones, with Chinese coast guards and

China has seen a significant rise in the number of students taking part in extracurricular activities like fencing, golf and equestrian.

According to Education Ministry figures, the number of students taking part in fencing competitions has risen by more than 30 times from 2008 to 2016. The number of students playing golf has risen by more than 11 times over the same time period.

While extracurricular activities are growing in popularity among Chinese students, many are still not able to enjoy them because of cost concerns. A normal fencing outfit can cost at least 70,000 yuan ($10,500).

A growing number of parents are choosing to use savings or loans to fund their children’s extracurricular activities.","15th anniversary of spiritual transformation, nostalgia for spiritual life in China

For example, in 2016, many Chinese netizens expressed displeasure with some media articles that included a euphemism for ethnic ""chicken.""

In July 2017, Wang led a team of Falun Gong practitioners to a local police station, where they had been forced to present to interrogate two officers, who later admitted to Wang they were “picking quarrels between Falun Gong practitioners and the police.”  “I knew that the officers who were forced to face these situations, probably knew about it from their training,” Wang said. “The day I gave birth, they charged me with a crime, and after four days, the police broke through the protective skin covering with their clubs. My father was violently tortured and brainwashed. When I was about 18 years old, I lost all respect for my parents and my place in life. We were locked in a cage for over two years.”  Wang was diagnosed with terminal kidney disease in 2018 and lived on the streets, where he and his family members were deprived of basic necessities.

13,Will Vietnam become the next 'world's factory' as production moves away from China?,"A new exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History explores the long history of the Vietnamese in America.

The exhibit focuses on the Vietnamese-American experience, and highlights stories of immigrants who left their home country for a different life in the United States.

One exhibit includes a re-creation of a Vietnamese refugee boat that was rescued off the coast of Thailand.

For many Vietnamese-Americans, August 5, 2017 is a day they will never forget.

Many were in Vietnam when Hurricane Harvey struck, and rushed back to the US to help family and friends in Houston.

It was one of the largest mass evacuations since the war.

Some members of Houston’s Vietnamese community had not seen each other since 1975, when they fled Vietnam by boat to escape communism.

As China's economy slows, Vietnam is looking to become its next 'world's factory.'

In this episode, we explore the long history of the Vietnamese diaspora in America, from first-generation immigrants to their children and grandchildren.","China's industrial advantage as a low-cost manufacturing base in Southeast Asia is hard to find. The Chinese industrial base (TCB), the most abundant supply of plants in Southeast Asia, contains roughly 350,000 tons of regular production products — be it new machinery, tires, fish, cars, electronics, poultry, other commodities such as rice and wood or at most, unskilled Chinese in many fields. As of March 2017, the number of TSBs had grown to 340,000.

Another major factor limiting TSB growth is decreased investment in ""new capital."" In particular, increased investment is required to capitalise on new capacity from domestic and foreign private capital. China has invested $230 billion on new capital for the sector over the past three years. Increasing investment to such a degree will not be enough to reduce costs and find innovative solutions in the US.

State investment in the TSB market has increased steadily over the past two years to more than $300 billion, which represents nearly 25 per cent of total global TSB volume. In addition to the current slowdown, China's main retail-based enterprises have experienced substantial losses over the past three years as wages and costs have grown by 35-40 per cent or greater.

This is due in part to greater reliance on companies in China, which have adopted high-tech takeovers that reduce corporate costs. For example, Taiwanese and Vietnamese manufacturers recently brought in a combination of commodity exchanges, and domestically grown food is being made in China from Chinese sugar cane, soybeans and cane sugar crops.

All over the country, parts of the TSB market are under much tougher pressure, with Asian financial markets seeing losses this year ranging from 35-50 per cent to 90 per cent. In China, foreign private capital markets have also seen losses in the US as have their US counterparts.

The ""stock bubble"" that is South Korea has already burst and two key drivers of the market — the 2009 and
","While the US and its allies have begun their efforts to close some 5 million manufacturing plants across the country, Chinese industrial activity has not yet begun to undergo drastic transformation. That means some regions may see declines in exports, and high prices of products may be triggered. Manufacturing demand will likely shift away from manufacturing in the US in other countries such as Australia and some parts of Europe, as well as in Canada, as Beijing may not be willing to respond well to the pressures from Washington.In short, all these factors cannot be readily discerned as a result of slowing domestic economic growth. As a result, the implementation of a comprehensive plan to upgrade the country's manufacturing capacity has not been easy. This has made many possible changes, and China is now the largest industrial consumer in the world. The US has been demanding that China purchase a lot of US equipment, which China's response has been well taken into account.Moreover, despite some internal economic difficulties, industrial production has been declining in many developing countries, which have offered opportunities for further reforms. For example, the Hubei Province is one of the main production lines for the Hubei and Lingyun industries, which are both located in Taiwan, and can become a major hub for exporting infrastructure to overseas markets. Therefore, improving the manufacturing capacity of China will mean that, if the country goes through deep reforms, it will have a strong factory base.Another reason for the slow growth of the domestic economy is the ongoing China-proposed Silk Road Initiative (RRI). If the RRI is adopted, the country will likely experience some temporary slowdown in exports and consumption. In addition, the RRI also means a retreat from ""auto-tipping"" during manufacturing transition. From what I have seen, once the RRI has received political support, it would be relatively easy for companies to start their own factories. However, the ""auto-tipping"" may not be reversible, and it will be difficult for China to maintain a technological

","HONG KONG -- The chairman of China's national auto assemblers said China needs to build on its aggressive industrial policy -- which will leave the country ''hard at work'' in creating factories in low-wage sectors and high-tech products -- to close some of the country's ''significant loopholes.''As a result, he said China would make the strongest example of its reform effort in decades in many key sectors, including auto and television and telecommunications -- a key part of the country's economic growth plan.''China is also home to some of the world's biggest auto manufacturers,'' the chairman of China Auto Asia, Zhang Zonghao, said in a speech in Shanghai. ''And China has every reason to want to build a huge factory sector, and it has already done so.''Mr. Zhang was speaking at a conference on Wednesday in Shanghai organized by China Auto and a separate panel organized by U.S.-based companies and some member states of the Asian Development Bank.China's auto industry is emerging as a bright spot in the world's second-largest economy, but a downturn in the value of its exports suggests that growth is slowing and that China's growth is likely to slow again as growth slows.At stake is China's industrial strategy, which calls for vast investment in factories, high-tech services and ''core, high-value'' products -- including high-speed rail and telecommunications equipment -- to replace production jobs that have been done away with, making the sector increasingly dependent on foreign money.Some in China argue that the gradual deployment of China's industrial policies will have an impact on productivity.

Guojie reported: ""We will focus on at least two main regions, in the Mekong Delta region and in the Sea of Japan."" Dongguan - or northern Vietnam - covers about 10 per cent of the country, and three-quarters of its soybean landmass is in the port city of Mekong.

State broadcaster KCNA said about two million tonnes of smog-prone land was ­established by the beginning of the 20th century. Chinese and Vietnamese analysts suggested the Mekong Delta might contain some of the biggest smog-related problems in Vietnam's history, such as hazardous waste disposal, high levels of greenhouse gases in groundwater, surface contamination of surface water supplies and high pollution levels in its waterways. Beijing has proposed banning up to 40 per cent of domestic smog-related polluters and limiting the scope of local environmental activities on the belt and road plan to 200 billion cubic metres per year.

That was also when KUDOS decided to begin a high-profile campaign to fight for Malaysia's seat in the parliamentary assembly and increase representation. They launched a barrage of online attacks and raids against at least 11 law offices, in many key cities, including Sabah, Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

It was a massive campaign, but also a necessary one for securing electoral points, and for mobilising the electorate in spite of opposition from the capital. Although a year removed from the own November electoral victory, the campaign is still beating the projected margin for seats, the ultimate goal of the newly formed National Liberal Party (NMP). This year's election is already shaping up to be one of the most challenging of the two decade-long political leadership succession contests in Malaysia.

Malaysian Opposition Leader said leaders would have to resist pressure

In a deal with its largest member, a powerful Financial Services Commission, Prime Minister Najib Razak's government has determined that it is easier for the NMP to win at this year's election than in past elections. He declared the looming election ""good news"" and vowed to ""strengthen the rules and fight their efforts"" against the opposition at this level. He is considering further bills for disallowing more Malaysians to vote and further blocking any outside groups from promoting their candidacy.

This past June, this last year's elections featured the support of Malaysians with an affinity for democracy, with Separatist and Parti Asian groups allegedly helping the campaign. At the same time, the number of observers at last count could become ever larger, as a million voters asked from all over the country have now registered their intentions as a direct result of the numbers that suddenly appeared at polling stations.

China, which is hoping for American-style rights, wants United to allow its transcontinental flight to take passengers to and from China in a two-way, 12-hour, seven-minute flight, in exchange for preferential American boarding services.The Beijing route is known as the North America 800 route and has been the preferred route of American carriers to try to expand their market there. This week, for example, United said it was extending that route to six more cities starting in 2018.The remarks by Mr. Zucker caused a stir on Sunday, when Chinese-born American television personality Chen Yuntao responded to Mr. Zucker's remarks by showing him a copy of his book ''Communist Society,'' which details the Communist Party's striving to ''demonize'' the Communist Party.

However, passenger service department of the airline has submitted a petition to the airline to allow the passenger compartments to be booked in China on the same side. The petition was lodged by national railway industry group (MRASC) in the mail on Monday. With both the Chinese passengers and the Indian ones sharing the same seats, further arrangements were made. Qashivas Motor Limited in Singapore and Dr Kuthu were also allowed to board. Only a few passengers have private bus passes. This has made the connecting between Kolkata and Bhopal even more difficult. Traffic is routed through gate 96 and Qashivas on the other side is a busy thoroughfare. Qashivas doesn't operate vehicles, which makes some passengers uncomfortable because of their stringent anti-dumping duties. Hence, they have offered to add about Rs 4.50 per kg of coal fuel to the ration cards of Indian passengers. They had earlier offered to buy ration card for Rs 6.50 per kg and an additional amount of R-3 to passengers travelling from Diwali and other markets in the two markets where both companies operate. Qashivas has done this in recent weeks. It now offers Rs 4.50 per kg of coal fuel per day which is Rs 6 per kg and can be used to buy 5 kg of coal on the same day. In December this year, Malaysian and Chinese firms offered fuel packets of Rs 6.50 per kg.

17,China creates milestone by doubling the number of world's affluent population,"2015/08/27

China has become the first country in the world to have more than 100 million people in the high-income group, according to a report released by the World Bank on Thursday.

China's gross national income per capita is expected to reach $14,285 in 2018 and $16,406 in 2020, said the World Bank report ""China 2030: Building a Modern, Harmonious, and Creative High-Income Society.""

In 2014, China had 101.1 million people in the high-income group with a per capita income of more than $16,000. The per capita income in China is expected to rise to $18,815 in 2021.

China's per capita income is expected to reach $16,406 in 2020, far beyond the threshold of high-income countries, said Li Wei, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank.

The report also suggests China's economic growth will sustain its momentum this year with real GDP growth expected to reach 6.8 percent, slightly higher than the government's target of between 6.5 percent and 7 percent. In the second quarter of this year, China's economy expanded 6.7 percent year-on-year.

""The external environment remains positive for China,"" said Ma Tianjie, a senior economist with CEBM Group. ""In addition to domestic investment demand, we can see from the data released by China's customs that both foreign direct investment and exports are growing well.""

Therefore, Chinese authorities are likely to maintain economic growth at a relatively fast pace this year as well as next year, he said.","15th anniversary of Brazilian cinema cuts?

I have been making this point for some time, but when it comes to the forthcoming Brazil 20th anniversary of the brilliant Brazil screen casting by Novisa Rybach from high school of madcap Martin Knight, it's become frustrating. In short, maybe something along these lines seems inevitable. In the past few days, the state has ordered four more movies to open in Brazil's right flank -- but they are all reportedly - or, as the same newspaper detailed in a report, - ""produced in Brazil only by ""an independent non-governmental body."" But without a guarantee that those films will indeed cross borders, I am not convinced that this has anything to do with the upcoming 2018 release of the ultimate pictures from the newly revealed Microsoft Pictures, which is expected to hit cinemas by 2016.

To me, any assurances that these box office successes are solely due to some kind of ""deluxe"" setting or to quality control do not pass muster for me, or about the right to enjoy movies either from Sao Paulo or Santiago, even though I have seen them -- inasmuch as they are simply far better quality films.

Although a benchmark year-on-year growth rate of 6.7 percent, China's consumption income stood at 10.36 billion yuan ($11.3 billion), making it the second largest market by a wide margin, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.China's consumption income increased from 5.7 percent in 2007 to 6.2 percent in 2017, up 59.4 percent year-on-year. The average family income grew from 37,300 yuan to 46,200 yuan in 2017, and became China's fifth-largest, the report said.The rise in consumption income came despite rising structural problems including a slump in manufacturing and an easing in commodity prices, while the rise in housing prices has accelerated consumption activity in China, according to a report by Beijing-based Boao Investment Institute, which listed China as one of the five ""most important economic growth zones in China,"" but the rise was also driven by labor costs and lower yields.Statistics from the Department of Finance (DOC) showed that the annual consumption income rate, with income between 25,000 and 39,000 yuan, reached 40.9 percent in 2015.

Wray  said in an interview with BBC “What We Can’t Do With Our Money: How Our Country Failed and Will We Face Disaster?”  Speaking at the world’s largest financial conference World Economic Forum (WEDF), Wray said that although the U.S. cannot afford to lose its 5G investment, it will not only struggle but also “begrudgingly” withdraw from the “Great Famine” of the last decade.  “If we fail to push through changes to the banking system that do not appease the Chinese, then we will struggle with other countries, particularly in the Middle East and South America,” Wray said.  He said China must “immediately restore some confidence in the system” as it continues to lead the world’s leading global economy, ahead of a planned 12-nation, Five Eyes agreement in London in September.  “The six leaders’ obligations to the United States of America and the European Union are very clear: we will not betray our values and take the United States for granted and continue to deceive others and try to get things done to ourselves,” Wray said.

He did so with $65 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the post. Tencent's China arm has made clear it has not been pressured to back the new hire. A draft of the notice, which was circulated to employees on Tuesday, outlined Mr. Xu's ambitions and reasons for joining the company. Mr. Xu will help oversee Tencent's push into new technology categories, as well as expanding into educational and technical capabilities for its smartphone customers.Many experts are skeptical that such a powerful position will provide Mr. Xu enough clout in a Chinese tech industry dominated by traditional state-owned enterprises. Companies such as Apple and Microsoft have grown significantly in China's smartphone market in recent years as companies as big as Alibaba, Tencent's parent company, inject their skills into the market. Mr. Xu's appointment could make that more difficult for analysts, as regulators and citizens have tightened limits on all speech that is being made in China.

As per Indian law, gold and diamonds are designated as silver or bronze by the Indian government and cannot be imported, further reflecting a shift in the role played by the diamond industry in industries outside India.The achievement of the diamond industry in 2008-09 has increased significantly by 15 percentage points to nearly 1,000 cubic metres (cm2). At present, the diamond market in China is expanding at a rate of over 15 per cent annually, comprising import and export operations. Diamond investment reaches $ 1,953 crore and the total annual production is estimated to be more than 6 million metric tons (kg).The diamond industry in China was formed in the 1890s, a time when diamond production was high in China. But since Chinese gold became available in the market in 1914, production and prices fell significantly. Diamond is grown commercially in China and is often used for decorative and hardworking stones. Chinese diamond companies started using rough stones like diamond tungsten for diamond products only in 1984.The diamond mining industry in China has recently brought about a huge increase in the percentage of domestically produced diamonds to over 5 per cent from the pre-1990 level of 4 per cent. The changes have reduced the diamond production to a relatively low level of 5.8 million metric tons (kg), therefore, the total volume of the diamond industry has not increased much since then.Diamond output in China has increased by 22 per cent annually from 2.36 million metric tons (kg) in 1988, the year that the government declared the global diamond production at 4 million metric tons (kg).During the current gold and

“It is not that you can’t get it from outside China, but the price is too high,” said a video blogger in China on the video sharing website Bilibili.

Another added: “I really wanted to buy a new iPhone in Hong Kong, it’s cheaper and I can get a lot of yuan.”

The ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing has seen both sides impose tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods.

Apple has been caught by the trade war because it manufactures most of its products in China. The tariffs have increased the costs of importing these products into the US and slowed down Apple's sales in China. Apple's new iPhones were launched on Wednesday, but when they were released in China they were not as popular as in previous years due to the tariff dispute between the US and China.

Apple's new iPhone 11 costs between $ 749 and $ 1,099 in the US. In China it costs about $ 70 more than in the US. But since the tariffs are imposed on all imports from the US into China, the prices are even higher than that. In fact, China imposes a 15% tax on imported goods which is higher than the 5% rate set under Trump's tariffs against China.

Beijing (AFP) - The high prices of products purchased by Chinese exporters had ""shock and alarm"" effects on them, but other policies had little effect, the Chinese government's expert body on Chinese national industries said Wednesday.

It blamed ""overwhelming evidence"" showing that - unlike many other consumer goods - China's exports are weak.

""We believe the relevant regulation related to imports and exports is very weak and has little effect,"" a committee tasked with overseeing the country's national industries warned on its Web site.

""It's difficult to show that illegal trade practices can be recovered from shock and alarm.""

According to Reuters, 40 percent of China's imports were from those U.S.-supplied vehicles that were manufactured for U.S. producers, another 10 percent was from manufactured Chinese parts or services, and 10 percent from fruits and vegetables, a source said.

But the committee warned that Chinese Chinese exports were determined primarily by the amount of labor-intensive costs, equipment and labor-to-capacity (LTE), which are subject to hard-cover limits.

For that, the committee recommended easing 3.5 percent of the volume regulation requirement on imports - giving foreign speculators 40 years of possible volatility, making the percentage of domestically manufactured manufactured Chinese products - in half from zero.

Not everyone agrees, but it is likely ""crash and shocks"" will wipe out demand from items from everyday life, and caused even more ""panic"", the report said.

""There will not be a transition period in shipping China's foreign consumer products in terms of service from domestic, service-based to service-oriented consumers, which will lead to downward pressure on global domestic sales,"" it said.

","While the US and the EU have begun their efforts to close some European Union borders and quarantine some Chinese migrants, China's most serious pandemic threat lies in the mere fact that some of its 3 million infected Chinese have already been returned to China. There is no reason for the world to allow the deaths of the 3.3 million infected to trigger the escalation of a trade war over common Chinese concerns and the Chinese government. Many in the media had expected a ""combined trade war"" with the US. China has been unequivocal in stating that it is only acceptable that Chinese imports in the face of increased pressure from US suppliers will be subject to tariff reductions, and the US will never simply shut down its supply chain. But if China strictly implements the normal tariff schedule in the face of such pressures, they will fall victim to a new wave of pandemic suffering in the US. It is impossible for China to accept the current deal. After all, if the US forces China to fully release its leaders, and Chinese people will live in peace and enjoy their fruits, it is unreasonable for China to reject this deal. That is why Chinese people should not join the moral crusade of replacing the COVID-19 fever with something more sinister.

The Epoch Times didn't report on the tariffs, but we have reported on the role of the WTO to the U.S. government since the Trump administration signed an executive order banning Chinese goods from entering the United States.Trump has also blocked Chinese tech firms from advancing technology within his administration, saying it violates trade agreements. The president said the measures are aimed at stifling innovation and forcing Chinese companies to find other ways to compete in the United States.For example, the administration has slapped duties on about $50 billion worth of imported technology from three Chinese universities: Princeton University, Oxford University, and UMass-Amherst, as well as in China with Chinese competitor FTSE 100 and U.S. and foreign firms' patents on Tesla vehicles.The tariffs were particularly severe on oil, and caused a stir among some experts.

An expert from Japan, who asked for anonymity, said, ""China has suffered a large amount of losses from its poor market.

","The latest US-China importer, China Foreign Exchange International (CSI), has been hit with serious US$250 million fine after losing the most lucrative red bar in a decade at its yuan-denominated agents trading onshore at an average exchange rate of 39 per cent. Seven of the 11 CSI agents in the US had a turnover of US$200 million, the company said in a filing to US securities regulators in US media.“The company had concluded that many of the same trading practices were used to justify further losses for CSI,” CSI said in a statement in the filing.CSI manages cash holding interests of top Shanghai-listed private equity firms. In March, the firm reported six-month losses of US$208 million in US$3.55 billion, totalling 62 per cent of its portfolio, in a move that US authorities were reportedly expressing frustration over the company’s lack of transparency in managing its positions.The importer posted a profit of 91 million yuan (HK$92.6 million) in the period ending March 31, nearly double its US$248 million gross profit in the same period last year, according to CSI data, released by the regulator on Friday.The firm is therefore under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s investigation into the alleged trading practices at its agents, in particular trading on the wire at an average exchange rate of 39 per cent for two of the 11, making the scandal an all-time low.CSI’s competitor, China Merchants Securities and Counterfeit Line and JPMorgan Chase, which have more than US$70 billion in assets under management, also reported losses of US$34.1 million. CSI, meanwhile, reported a loss of US$44 million.But foreign exchange regulator OTC halted the yuan selling, in response to concerns over the firm’s ""robust"" trading practices.

20,"Facing crazy iFans, Chinese enterprises should be more confident and competitive","Chinese smartphone brands, such as Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo, have been making good headway in the overseas market. In the latest quarter of 2015, Huawei shipped 15.3 million smartphones globally, becoming the third-largest smartphone vendor in the world after Samsung and Apple.

Huawei's flagship model, the P8, has been a hot seller in Europe since its launch in March. Its sales volume has exceeded 1 million units in several European markets including Germany and the UK.

In the first quarter this year, Huawei became the third-largest maker of smartphones in Japan, after Samsung and Sony, according to data from Japanese market research firm MM Research Institute.

Xiaomi has also become one of the most popular smartphone brands in India. In 2015 Q1, Xiaomi ranked second among all smartphone vendors in India with an 18% market share, according to data from the International Data Corporation (IDC).

Chinese smartphone vendors are now focusing on emerging markets such as Southeast Asia and Latin America. The emerging market is expected to be a big growth area for smartphone vendors due to a huge potential for consumer spending. For example, Brazil is expected to become one of the most important markets for smartphones in Latin America in 2016. According to a report by global consultancy firm ABI Research, Brazil will become the largest smartphone market in Latin America by 2018 thanks to China's fast-growing influence in the country.

The emerging market is not only a big growth area for smartphone vendors but also a testing ground for them to compete with each other. Chinese smartphone vendors are improving their performance in this area due to their keen understanding of local consumer demands as well as their lower cost structure due to lower labor costs and simpler production processes.

In addition, Chinese smartphone vendors are offering more affordable models and focusing on consumers' interests rather than on high-end products or high profit margins. This strategy has made Chinese brands increasingly competitive compared with Apple and Samsung Electronics","15th April: The chairman of Alibaba had suggested selling some 5 million shares of common shares on its Chinese board

Like fintech today, Beijing is dreaming of a singular postponement for what China has lost for the world.

One could speculate the ultimate goal could be the return of China's crippled economy to relative prosperity.

However, if so, China's response is probably wrong. In order to revive its growth and grow economic activity for years to come, the Communist Party must seek serious reform and swiftly process it.<|endoftext|>
","While the US and the EU have posted negative views toward China in 2017, China hasn't shown aggressive measures toward China on the AIIB level. Most prominent in such countries are Japan and South Korea. However, from 2018 to 2019, a massive amount of financial support was offered to aid South Korea, Japan and Japan's economy. Given the recovery in Japan, South Korea and Japan could make more investments in China. Some Chinese enterprises like Intuit have done well in recent years, with a large investment base in areas like auto technology, aerospace, telecom, financial services and related industries.One notable example is Shenzhen-based Beijing Beer, which raised nearly $62.9 billion in 2015. This company is still not a multinational company, but was once valued at US$3.2 billion, and raised $97.2 billion in 2016, up 4.5 percent year-on-year.Moreover, despite some ups and downs in industrial and technology cooperation between China and Japan in recent years, Chinese enterprises still tend to struggle to deal with its high cost of labor and high mobility, which makes it difficult to gain market share in emerging markets.Third, China, as an emerging economy, needs to become more competitive to attract foreign investors. While the initial investment in e-commerce platforms and smart cities in China, which was used to absorb losses from US entry into the e-commerce sector, is still a relatively small piece of the pie, given the low cost of labor and relatively fast growing local economy. Chinese enterprises should be more confident and play more proactive to recruit foreign firms.No country wants to be led by a shadow government by ambitious firms and management with limited financial resources, but it's common for them to not have confidence when they see mistakes. In China, foreign companies should think about how to be more cooperative in the future.Under such circumstances, Chinese companies should make efforts to improve their business in a timely manner and integrate with their local counterparts.The author is a
","The World Trade Organization (WTO) has had a hard time dealing with China's notorious human rights abuses since it began formally assessing the country's trade practices in March, a new document, released on July 11, from the department of international trade reveals.According to the report, which was obtained by The Epoch Times, a group of experts from the World Trade Organization, the organization found in July that Chinese authorities “have consistently pursued unfair treatment of Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim minorities.” Most recently, on June 8, the U.N. Human Rights Council has condemned Beijing’s campaign to curb civil liberties in Xinjiang and has called for an international investigation into the origins of the outbreak.The Chinese regime has used such tactics to assert its claims over territory in the region, accusing them of having moved vast tracts of land from Muslim lands to build its new national park, Sichuan, on the edge of its ancient border, located on the Indian Ocean.Uyghurs, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim minorities have been denied basic rights since Chinese authorities forcibly expelled thousands of Tibetans, Mongolians, and Kazakh Muslims from their villages in 1911. The Chinese regime often uses the issue as an opportunity to directly challenge and bully Uyghurs and other Muslims, claiming that they “have adopted Islam as its religion.” In May, Xinjiang's Uyghur region governor, Hulagu Kailashar, said that the Kazakhs and Kazakhs were “fundamentalist republics of a certain degree,” adding that they had been converted into a “jihad army” in 2013. From the time the U.S. Department of State established the Uyghur Autonomous Region, in 1949, to the end of the year, no independent human rights investigators have been allowed to look into such crimes.Some prominent Uyghurs and Kazakh

It quoted a statement from the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the agency that controls internet and television media. It said they had been sentenced to six months in prison.''The accused are detained without giving a reason, rather than being formally charged,'' the report said, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency.An English translation of the report on Tuesday night did not mention a charge of conspiracy to set up a illegal online auction site. It said they were arrested after supporting a web site called BaoYu auction and a site called CQiao auction, which took place on Oct. 1 and is run by the person who had posted the fake auction and offered it for about $1.6 million.China also paid a fine to the Internet Police Bureau in the neighboring province of Zhejiang, according to the report, which did not mention the charges.''We discovered a criminal violation of criminal law,'' the report said.The two men were sentenced to six months, according to the official statement. Two other suspects were sentenced to four years and three years in prison, according to Xinhua.The articles on the BaoYu website were linked to in news reports on the main forums of the Chinese social network WeChat and posts that read like ''Who Is Charles Liu?'' Some people on Weibo and Sina Weibo declared the figures outrageous and cited the postings on the sites.Experts have said the authorities in Zhejiang had shown their willingness to engage in investigations in case of any issues.Under the online auction, the original founder of the auction site, Mr. Liu, agreed to pay $18,000 to the police and

He faces a massive amount of financial risk that leads to severely scrutinizing his business practices. Dorjee had earlier made public statements against Chinese companies, even saying that in many cases Chinese enterprises had engaged in some kind of unfair labour. He had come under intense pressure recently following massive protests against Chinese actions, which included firing down more than 100 Chinese managers at the Chinese consulate in Kolkata last week.The state justice of the court, Xuerui Hu, has alleged that the CCP has used a Trojan horse, Microsoft Exchange, to infiltrate the territory of local organisations and they have raised huge funds on the basis of stolen assets. The corruption continues unabated despite the government having suspended some 25 companies and launched illegal activities for several months. Dorjee is alleged to have promised his followers that he would make inroads in the local market and create more jobs. Also participating in the discussion about the demonization of Chinese enterprises is China Prospect Exchange, which is the world's largest provider of digital credit with major brands operating in India, China and Japan, according to a survey by Chinese FinanceWire.

25,Authorities in Southwestern Germany Concerned About Chinese Industrial Espionage,"The following report is largely based on a story from the German business outlet Handelsblatt, which cites anonymous sources in the German security apparatus. The story is largely about the case of a Chinese-born engineer who was arrested recently in Germany for allegedly taking plans of an entire production facility for high-voltage switching devices to China. The man was employed by a subsidiary of the large German electronics manufacturer Siemens, but worked in a plant belonging to the Swiss-Italian power grid and automation technology company ABB.

Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BfV) has reason to believe that the Chinese man was not acting on his own accord, but rather under instructions from Chinese intelligence services. The BfV reportedly suspects that it may be part of a much larger industrial espionage campaign carried out by China against Germany and other Western countries.

The report says that federal prosecutors are currently investigating around ten cases involving Chinese espionage in Germany. It cites anonymous security officials as saying that they are increasingly concerned about Chinese efforts to obtain information about high-tech products of interest to Beijing, including new technologies such as those used in electric cars and power grids. They also claim that China is seeking to gain access to trade secrets held by German companies through the use of cyber attacks. They say that Chinese intelligence services have attempted to recruit German-based scientists who work for firms such as Siemens, Volkswagen, and other firms active in the German industrial sector. According to an unnamed security official, “The threat posed by China is increasing, as is its effort to steal technology from Germany.”

The Handelsblatt report does not specify what type of information China is trying to obtain from German firms, nor does it provide any evidence that Beijing has targeted any specific company or technology. It does not cite any specific case or incident that would indicate whether or not the Chinese government has been successful in its alleged efforts to obtain sensitive information from","15th anniversary of the German Fluomte Massacre 2nd annual Bluialide Materials Agreement on December 11th 2011 (TCMMB) and for the first time (DLNA Documentarians' Association of Germany) has discovered many critical data relating to Chinese espionage programs that were installed prior to the 1994 World Trade Center Event. The cover of the 2014 Bluialide Materials Agreement is a full text of this agreement released on September 8, 2010. Every cent of all expenditures on DTMMB that end upon its expiration, ending at the estimated end of Q3 2010–2015 in the United States, reflect exposure and compliance challenges. Although access to these data and content was not required for DTMMB to report on this information, this document may contain confidential information regarding East Germany. The data required for DTMMB to recognize these programs as espionage, however, may be sensitive. All investment and dissemination payments to China related to DTMMB for industrial espionage programs to the United States do not pass through and are not subject to the restrictions provided in the GDPR.

","While the US and the EU have begun their efforts to close some European Union borders and quarantine some Chinese workers, China still worries about espionage, as this year marks the 50th anniversary of its historic founding. Today, it has faced many international espionage probes related to espionage, cyber espionage and sabotage, including ones involving Guo Lijian, the president of Huawei. According to Chinese statistics, in 2015, Chinese enterprises released 221 million US dollar-denominated criminal probes against 11,000 countries, all of which involved Huawei, according to Wang Yixi, director of the Center for International Politics and Law at Fudan University. Although these probes are mainly targeting civil-society organizations and criminal organizations, such probes also show that China's strict adherence to its democratic process and market system has been regarded as a key strategy in anti-spying, especially in Western countries. It is impossible to suspect the existence of foreign espionage activities within China, but in addition to Huawei itself, many Chinese companies have built factories in China to supply employees with training, help them in addition to studying engineering skills, attend high-level parties and give Chinese telecommunications equipment makers and others a boost, Wang told the Global Times.At the same time, China has also focused on internet and other technological fields, believing that Chinese people need ""to feel like the world is more equal"" and that technology is a good technology for everyone.This is the beginning of a possible anti-spy fight, according to Wang. According to statistics from 2014, the number of French companies and universities cooperating with Chinese and foreign firms in security and social research reached 180,000, up by 15 percent year-on-year, figures from 2008 showed.China-backed groups have continuously promoted cyber security and increase efforts to fight foreign interference, Wang noted. However, some Western companies are still unwilling to cooperate with China, including Huawei, and have even spent money on espionage investigations, he said.Some Western universities are still based in the

The other foreign agents were required to stay in the consulate building until Nov. 4, before leaving.According to U.S.-based German media Deutsches Janssen, foreign spies operate in different areas of the Chinese capital and live in the compound. We refer to them as ""foreign agents."" Under Chinese law, espionage-related activities are punishable by up to seven years in prison.The People's Republic of China (PRC) announced that it would cut off communication with China in a two-week period beginning on Oct. 8.

Due to bilateral economic issues, the two countries have been locked into a bitter trade war.In June, the former communist regime criticized the communist regime for doing business with China, calling it ""a force for good"" in its relations with the PRC.In July, the regime's decision to lift the South China Sea was followed by two months of backlash against the Chinese regime's actions
","HONG KONG -- The German government called on China on Thursday for its citizens to not be concerned with Chinese industrial espionage because there is a continuing ''evil spirit'' in the Communist Party that targets citizens for espionage. The ministry of civil affairs called on citizens to be ''mindful and cooperative'' in efforts to protect their freedom of speech and livelihood and to resist Chinese policies, state-run publications and online media have reported.In a Sunday blog post, the ministry said the Chinese Communist Party's ruling Communist Party had used surveillance, coercive tactics and blackmail to move people from their homes in mainland China in the last several years to ''subvert, distort, steal and take advantage of citizens' rights.''The ministry did not name a specific suspect, or explain the specific actions the Chinese government has been waging against citizens, but it quoted Liu He, the head of China's Civil Protection Department, as saying there were fears that Chinese espionage activities were ''increasingly directed at the people who live in East and West China, in order to disturb the daily lives of its people and make decisions about the future of China,'' the Global Times newspaper reported.''The mass security measures China is undergoing this year and the danger they are building up to this point are disturbing the harmony of peoples' lives,'' the newspaper quoted Liu as saying in that Sunday blog post.''Such activity takes advantage of the fear of spreading rumors and direct threats in order to defuse internal tensions and inspire others to fight for national independence,'' the newspaper added.In 2014, the Guangdong Province authorities orchestrated a widespread wave of surveillance that apparently targeted anyone who ''removed any warning, suggestion or information about anyone, illegal activities or personal figures from all schools, offices, factories or other educational buildings.''The last similar mass surveillance has involved political dissidents in Guangdong Province in 2007.In an effort to keep citizens from growing alarmed over Chinese concerns, residents around the city of Shenzhen and other key cities in the country have flooded the Internet

","The Chinese regime ’s persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China continues unabated, human rights defenders say.  The Falun Dafa Information Center in Shandong Province, an independent research center, published on Jan. 20 a report titled “China’s Official Report on Falun Dafa” noting that the Chinese regime employs at least 11 state-sanctioned criminal organizations against Falun Gong practitioners in China’s Hebei Province, as well as various state-run institutions, such as Jiangsu Prison, Pingtung High Detention Center, and the Tianjin Youth and Youth Organizations.  “Authorities have previously punished Falun Gong practitioners for their organs, brainwashing, and cultural practices,” Huang Chi, a lawyer and former Hong Kong legislator who currently serves on a Falun Dafa Commission, told The Epoch Times. “They will also expel them if they are found to be the source of organs for transplants.”  On Jan. 23, a mass grave in Changsha city, Guangdong Province, opened to find organs for transplant surgery, according to local newspaper, the Hong Kong Times, adding that it is believed to be Falun Gong’s burial ground.  CCP officials reportedly persecuted Falun Gong practitioners for their organs in China’s jails and mass-circumvention centers during the early years of the CCP, according to Huang.  In November 2018, in an effort to contain the spread of the Chinese regime’s coverup and communist propaganda efforts to criticize Falun Gong, the Falun Dafa Information Center released a report titled, “The Threat of Organ Harvesting.”  The report predicted that the persecution of Falun Gong adherents by the CCP would continue as authorities “decouple all organs from human remains and customs that allow for transplants.”  Some prominent medical practitioners, such as the

In March 2009, the Chinese authorities announced that he had been detained, but said he had ''left peacefully.''Reports of human rights abuses are notoriously difficult to report because the Chinese government depends on Chinese Internet users and human rights lawyers to defend its line of actions, like releasing news reports about independent Tibetans fleeing persecution or detaining Tibetans in a military camp.The report added that, since the meeting in November 2008, China had spent more than $1 million on giving universities tuition grants for candidates of opinion and public service, partly to help local students hold lawyers' testimony and to promote the gradual deployment of traditional Chinese culture and literature.China's richest state-owned firms have been able to make large purchases of much of the country's media and television assets. Other Chinese companies -- including Huawei and the state-owned Sichuan shipping giant Dongfeng Holding -- have also invested in important public companies as part of a broader campaign of campaign against ''radical nationalism'' that is being waged by President Xi Jinping's administration.The report said that Beijing and the

The Chinese media said Li and her fellow officials visited several state-owned enterprises, including the state-run World Belt and Road Co. Ltd, and enjoyed further indulgence, participating in Chinese national football championship in Beijing. Li's US counterpart had also done so while travelling with Chinese president Xi Jinping. The Chinese government has also been supporting Wang Jiang, the former premier, who has suffered a face-saving beating from President Trump last week after a surge in his poll ratings. A Reuters report reported on Tuesday said she met Wang and other officials, who was accompanied by Huang Chi, the local prime minister, and other officials. Wang, Wang's counterpart, is also expected to be visiting US investment bank Wachovia International and some member state companies during the next eight months.  The two leaders will also hold a meeting to discuss trade and development with the US in addition to the visiting media, according to the Reuters report. The Chinese parliament has passed a new pro-business bill with a focus on measures to boost investment. The bill aims to increase investment to the tune of about US$1.9 trillion in China, according to Reuters. Li also participated in the 20th edition of the Beijing Business Cultural Hall during the 40th annual Economic and Cultural Days, the inaugural annual conference of the party's leadership. It also approved a plan to create and maintain the 19-member ""Trojan Horse"" of the party.

27,"Malaysia PM Aims to Renegotiate 'One Belt, One Road' Projects While Visiting China","Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he will renegotiate projects signed by his predecessor with Beijing.

(Bloomberg) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he will renegotiate projects signed by his predecessor with Beijing, sending Chinese stocks tumbling.

In a press briefing Saturday before departing for China, Mahathir said he couldn’t say whether the projects would proceed, but that they would be reviewed. “The contracts are there, but we want to renegotiate,” he said.

Mahathir’s comments come amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese investments in Malaysia after a graft scandal linked to 1MDB, a fund founded by his predecessor Najib Razak, triggered a political upheaval in the country. Najib has been charged with corruption and money-laundering offenses related to the scandal.

The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell as much as 0.3 percent and Chinese stocks declined after Mahathir’s remarks were reported. The ringgit slid against the U.S. dollar as Mahathir’s comments were interpreted as a signal that China won’t be allowed to dominate the country economically.

“I think it’s going to be hard for the new government to continue with many of Najib’s investments in China and infrastructure projects,” said James Chin, director of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania in Australia. “It’s likely to be more of a rebalancing of ties between Malaysia and China.”

Mahathir had previously said that he would review all deals and contracts signed by his predecessor since he came into power more than two months ago following a stunning election victory against Najib. The 92-year-old leader has accused his former protege of stealing billions from Malaysia’s 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, which was set up","15th anniversary of Kuala Lumpur Chief Minister Najib Razak Speech at Liberal Mathers Conference

","While the US and its allies have begun their ""one-China policy,"" China and Malaysia are concerned with the attitude of the ASEAN countries and Southeast Asian nations toward China's shift to Asia. Malaysia has felt that China will shrink into a peripheral region and will try to strike back against Malaysia. Malaysia does not want to see China rule the region, or at least the region is concerned about the region's development. Malaysia's right to autonomy and territorial integrity is fundamental and everyone wants to take that as a sign of international law. All this has created a huge ""China threat.""Malaysia is seeking a constructive way out. Although a pragmatic approach, the new South China Sea tribunal has been criticized. What about the arbitration? How do the ASEAN countries deal with the arbitration? The ASEAN nations are split on the issue of arbitral claims and disputes between China and Malaysia. How can Malaysia fight back and solve these disputes? Recently, Singapore has opened itself up to Beijing's concerns and offered to add Malaysia to the special deal with the tribunal. Could a ""no-stale"" China move to improve relations with Malaysia facilitate China's efforts?On the contrary, China and Malaysia have no intention to stoke tensions or push forward a wedge between China and Southeast Asian countries. This is what China has always stood for. The Sino-Malaysian consensus has been recognized by everyone. There is no excuse for both sides to seek confrontation. If China can lead the ASEAN nations to achieve certain goals, then it will be of great benefit to both sides. No country will criticize China. China hopes the region can unite with Southeast Asian countries and maintain regional stability. Other countries will continue to view China with suspicion and hostility. This is just China's foreign policy. It is not a clash of civilizations. It's China's way of peaceful development. It's the only way the South China Sea can be developed. Malaysia will not remain indifferent. The South China
","The Chinese regime ’s plans to consolidate a framework for “One Belt, One Road” infrastructure projects under the AIIB initiative, as part of its “Asian Belt and Road” initiative, has faced criticism on a range of platforms from Australia’s prime minister to Beijing.  Chinese state media recently ran articles claiming that at the moment Indonesia is operating in the region as part of “One Belt, One Road.” While they dismissed the statement, they stated that Indonesia was part of the “Five Eyes” multilateral project set up in May 2020.  The Beijing-funded Global Development Initiative (GDI) is China’s central geopolitical foreign policy and economic policy, the ultimate goal of which is to extend China’s influence into key African countries, Europe, and beyond.  If China were to implement the initiative, it would shift some of Indonesia’s sovereignty to the Australian state, while potentially threatening Australia’s sovereignty in the South Pacific. Australia also has an internal dispute with Indonesia over sovereignty over Indonesia’s disputed EEZ and has repeatedly expressed concern over what it sees as China’s meddling in affairs in the region.  In recent months, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, while speaking at a July 20 meeting in London, criticized China’s efforts to interfere in Australia’s internal affairs, specifically the detention of Indonesian police officers and national security agents in Sydney, in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.  While Australia is likely to take a more difficult approach to China’s influence in Australia, Payne said, it is still “troubling” that Indonesia would have to “deter” China’s move in terms of the “billions of dollars of economic opportunity and connectivity that the Chinese government is hoping to gain” by engaging in “non-state actors” around the region
","HONG KONG -- The chairman of Indonesia's national development bank, the State Development Bank, on Wednesday postponed a visit to China by President Trump, for fear of not meeting with a senior Chinese official.The time frame for Mr. Trump's planned visit is unclear, but the bank's remarks on Wednesday raise doubts about the American economy's prospects and its resiliency, Indonesia's state-run news media reported.Mr. Trump met with President Pranab Mukasa,the prime minister of Indonesia and the head of Indonesia's Development Bank, during a trip that lasted several days, and in May offered $250 million in cash for access to a Shanghai luxury hotel. A spokesman for the development bank declined to confirm Mr. Trump's interest in the deal.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump met with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the interior minister, at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and J.D. Power, another Trump adviser, were told, but no official in the Trump administration was present.The addition of the Chinese embassy to Mr. Trump's itinerary seemed aimed at cooling China's worries about what it might call ties between the United States and China. Mr. Trump's administration often negotiates with China in a two-way, while China has, for the most part, ignored that process.Analysts at PEN America, a conservative research firm, estimate that the combination of the Asia-Pacific region and China is being tied in China's long-term strategic interests, and this could affect the balance of power in the region. ''It's going to get very divisive with the Chinese, with Asian leaders, with the region, with everybody, basically,'' said Rod Dreier of PEN Australia.But foreign policy analysts in Australia have expressed worries about the diplomatic incentives for China, which has pursued a trade war with the United States over South Korea and North Korea since it emerged from the North's nuclear program and is

His meeting with Xi, however, comes on the heels of ongoing tensions with both China and India.

Activist and former legislator David Li said the law is a ""monumental"" step forward for gay rights in a country where the government issued its first policy document specifically targeting homophobia only in 2016.

The move reflects a broader progressiveness on social issues in China's predominantly male parliament. Last month, legislators passed a historic bill to protect women from domestic violence.

The number of criminal trials involving sexual relations between women increased by more than 50% from 2008 to 2016, according to the Supreme People's Court. The court said that while there were no specific laws against homosexual activity, the country's law against ""hooliganism"" could be applied to such cases.

Other observers called for further progress. ""This is a very good sign for China's lesbian community,"" commented Ying Xin, an associate professor at Sun Yat-sen University's Law School in Guangzhou. ""But it is still far from being perfect.""

The beginning of WWII was an unwinnable event, something that had to be resolved on the part of Japan at that time:

• Canada's armed forces lost many years in a sea of chaos.

• Japan was mired in war and civil war, indomitable debts, and only now finally made a deal to stop all involvement in war.

• Canada finally did a deal with Japan. Great deal. This didn't mean much, however. As Japanese civilians struggled to pay the full cost of the war, many lost hope that Canada would be able to stay out of it.

• Canada did a terrible job, actively fuelling another war. Canadian vietnam was the only non-Japanese country within a five-kilometre radius.

","The latest heavy rain in the Dongcheng Valley and the rainy season has brought great change in Chinese society. The rainy season has also brought the onset of typhoons such as Sino-Japanese competition and even the coronavirus outbreak.In 2017, Chinese people had become resilient and had started to improve. They had other options such as buying and selling flowers, fixing broken ones and beautifying cars. But thanks to strong and effective measures taken by local authorities, all these options were started to work.All these ingredients are conducive to building a strong society, therefore, Chinese people have grown resilient in spite of typhoons and disasters. Although typhoons are constantly occurring in South China's Guizhou Province, the whole country and China are back to normal, and Chinese people are no longer facing adversity. The Chinese people are on the cusp of a great transformation and a healing process. We hope to provide some resilience in some cities and neighborhoods in order to make the people who live in these areas more resilient, but it is also important to deal with the worst natural disasters that are haunting our lifetimes.China is still in a difficult period of China's recovery, which is still with a long way to go. Our hopes to improve our infrastructure is still to be realized and hope the two sides can reach a fruitful agreement, which is why our fight against the pandemic is now at an early stage. We know from history that when we fail to grasp our destiny, we can only repeat the mistakes made in previous times, and this was also true during the last 19 years. We should not be afraid of a certain disaster, nor must we worry that if we succeed at our journey, it will impact all the people on the earth. These are all the mistakes made in China's past, and our future can be both beautiful and joyful. Yet China will never be as resolute as we are, nor can it do anything like this to every country or every community.The World Health Organization

37,"Canada-China Committee Needed Now More Than Ever, Says Former Canadian Ambassador to China","September 8, 2017 – China’s Ambassador to Canada Qiu Xiaoqi, said it is high time for Canada to have its own bilateral committee with China.

He made the remarks while speaking to a gathering of prominent Canadian and Chinese citizens in Toronto at a talk titled “China-Canada Relations and Prospects of Engaging China.”

“We appreciate the fact that the Chinese community has had a very strong voice and influence in Canada,” said Ambassador Qiu. “It’s time for us to have our own bilateral committee with China.”

Mr. Qiu suggested that such a committee would be “invaluable, particularly in the current environment.”

He pointed out that Canada and China have not seen any official high-level visits between the two countries since Prime Minister Trudeau took office in November 2015.

“Since 2015, we have not seen any high-level official visit between Canada and China,” he said. “I don’t think there is any reason why we cannot have high-level visits from one another.”

In an interview with The Epoch Times after the forum, Mr. Qiu said that before the Liberal Party came to power, they had indicated that they would like to see a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Canada, which would then be reciprocated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau coming to China. Despite this being a reciprocal arrangement, Mr. Qiu noted that this arrangement “has not happened yet.”

Last month, Minister of International Trade François-Philippe Champagne visited Beijing for talks on free trade with his Chinese counterpart Zhong Shan.

Mr. Champagne was also accompanied by then NDP leader Tom Mulcair and Conservative critic for Asia Pacific David Lametti. All three opposition leaders are members of the Canada-China Parliamentary Friendship Group.

During his visit Mr. Champagne","China's ambassador to China, Xi Jinping, and the CICU have all received human rights complaints from China regarding the AIIB inspections and for alleged human rights abuses in China.

Still, the CICU is critical of China's new campaign to enter the global arena and — in the face of other American opposition — proposes the repeal of at least some of the Chinese national defense directives. Beijing may not like the idea of an American pressuring China on the issue, but it hopes to avoid violating UN Security Council resolutions, a shift that has given ""all the complacent and unscrupulous leaders"" in the hemisphere permission to expand its campaign to the new South China Sea.

David Foster Wallace, Chief Executive of the BCT Center, wrote in the Wall Street Journal about the BCT Center and China's new campaign:

""Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced last month that the mainland will build new submarines and destroy North Korea in addition to launching a ballistic missile in response to America's ultimatum to 'get rid of its' human rights record. Also participating are China's main weapons-based missile test and actions in the disputed South China Sea.

""The BCT Center is particularly concerned by reports of Chinese human rights abuses, particularly in the two exclusive Chinese territorial waters in the South China Sea.

""From a military perspective, its presence may not make a significant dent in North Korea's possible development, given the ongoing Soviet-Chinese nuclear test moratorium.""

Spokesman for China's Central Military Commission Yao Zhong and foreign ministry spokesman Hu Zhenwu explained the BCT Center's own position on China's illegal action and claims, following this article from the Wall Street Journal.

""The BCT Center has long acknowledged that its prior criticism of China's anti-China campaign have long been substantiated by a documentary, 'L'Aqué de la Moérea.' The revision of the statements of the 2009 Global
","While the spotlight that the remarks garnered on Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Canada has soured Canada's attitude on the AIIB, which for years has not been regarded as an alternative to the Belt and Road initiative, many international observers said that Harper's visit was an effective signal that the Canada-China Canada Strategic Partnership had earned the name of Canada. ""There was no Chinese national spirit in this visit. I doubt that the visit was done because of the tendency of many countries to make use of the visits, which are designed for strategic exchanges rather than long-term cooperation, and not necessarily reflect a constructive approach,"" Bai said. ""It's not because Canada is a totally isolationist country. What Canada is doing is strictly necessary to maintain the status quo."" But even though Harper has repeatedly expressed his support for Canada, Wang remains critical of China's strategic response. Canada's investment in AIIB regions like B.C., for example, was the only non-global investment within Canada and was almost always about the trade surplus. ""Beng Tan, a Canadian economist who now teaches at the Global Studies Institute of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that the COVID-19 pandemic may have made a negative impact on Canada's infrastructure investment, and in a two-way trade deal it has important advantages like preferential trade and investment for Chinese companies, which are not easy to make profit in China."" Wang, of course, has been the Canada's national ambassador to China since 1998 and has been on the Permanent Mission of China to Canada since 2007. However, that was in 2001 when Canada became the only party with the largest oil reserves and the second largest import of crude from China. At the time, Wang criticized China for overestimating the contribution of China to Canada's oil imports from the US and for misinterpreting China's energy purchase as a direct result of the pandemic.At this moment, Canada's two-way trade agreement with China is still in

Wong’s post was condemned by Russian and Chinese officials.  The video, posted on his YouTube channel on Jan. 6, was later found to have deleted the post.  The ad had appeared almost two weeks before the election, with a screenshot of Wong’s post. In a separate video, Wong made reference to the Chinese consulate in Beijing that is where Trump was detained in March and criticized its handling of the ongoing trial.  “I know how you feel, how the Russian government feels about the handling of this,” Wong said in the video, which showed photos of several secret trials before his imprisonment. “But the Chinese authorities don’t really want you to believe the lies,” he said.  The page about the trial was eventually taken down by Twitter, but Wong said it would remain up in the future.  “I would say if it was still on Twitter, the whole world wouldn’t be shocked because I’m proud of the Canadian government,” Wong said in the video. “That’s my only really positive thing.”  A bill that would bar Americans of Canadian descent from voting in Canada’s 2019 federal election in Ottawa on June 19, 2019.

","HONG KONG -- The chairman of China's national broadcasting regulator, the China Foreign Press Information Corporation, said on Wednesday that China needed more information and acknowledged that ''in most circumstances, foreign news media outlets, even from high-ranking officials, can be opaque and difficult to obtain.'' In remarks that echoed a wide-ranging American reaction to the Chinese government's recent request to state-run Chinese news media to open articles that were critical of China and its policies, Mr. Gao said the same thing about the broadcaster, Xinhua, a state-run news agency controlled by the Communist Party.The editorial, posted on China Central Television, a state-run news agency, featured a graphic on Sina.com about how a man with a strict vegetarian diet had been forced to keep fasting and required to wear a sleep mask on his stomach every night, suffering from pneumonia and vomiting.Xinhua cited Mr. Gao's comments about the man as one of the reasons why its release was so critical of the Chinese government. He has been detained in the past, but has not been charged with any crime.In recent months, Chinese state media have been flexing what they describe as ''foreign media propaganda,'' producing provocative photographs of people or groups promoting harmony in Xinjiang and pro-democracy demonstrations. Xinhua said that, since the terrorist attacks in Paris in November that killed 130 people, six journalists had been prosecuted or were recently arrested.After an investigation, the People's Daily newspaper released a verbatim news article on the rise of Islamic extremism and of the Rise of the Islamic State in China.The article said that many Uighurs had died of illnesses caused by the 2013 Xinjiang wars and cited the bodies of former separatists. According to Xinhua, the bodies of Mr. Gao, a former deputy police chief, were seized in late July and buried as a tribute to him.''Western journalists who can't report on Xinjiang are more likely to fall into the trap of
","MP3SUR: The former ambassador to China and former ambassador to India Richard Mather, on Wednesday said the absence of AIIB funding and aid in what is a critical sector for Chinese businesses has led to a perceived lack of transparency and trust among Chinese investors, whom are now lobbying aggressively for AIIB. ""We had earlier discussed the importance of a treaty,"" Mather said in his opening remarks at the ICAF International Investment Forum. ""But now we have many more questions about why China is giving AIIB funds for a few rather than providing them to the Chinese investor in spite of a convention against capital buying by Indian corporations.""In an interview with Marathwada on Tuesday, Mather recalled a conversation with Bala washesh Shah, an IT professional and a co-founder and managing partner at a leading Bala ishesh Shah Development Corporation. ""She said that if China raised another $100 billion for AIIB the Australian government would do the same. So, I pointed to the Convention against capital buying,"" Mather said. ""So they said if China raised another $100 billion Chinese would not join the treaty,"" he said. The China Taiwan Affairs Office (CCAO) in exile also voiced concern over the looming solution to the two-way trade imbalance in that country. More than 25,000 Chinese traders have crossed the Senkaku/Kazakhstan border for India. Economic experts, meanwhile, argue China can now launch more investment opportunities in Myanmar with Chinese investments. ""Actually, Chinese investment in Myanmar is nearly 30% over the $1 billion mark. That doesn't just affect our trade and economic interaction,"" said Amy Yang, associate professor at the UC Berkeley School of Business.

38,Scientist Suggest Infectious CCP Virus Mutations Could be the Cause of Hotel Quarantine Leaks,"(NaturalNews) In yet another bizarre twist in the saga of the mysterious ""hotel quarantine"" that took place at the Hyatt Regency in Kansas City, Kansas, last Monday, a virologist from Kansas State University has been called out to investigate. The virologist, Dr. Dirk Haselow, has a long track record of studying the infectious Chronic Cerebrospinal Venereal Disease (CCSD) virus. Now, Dr. Haselow's expertise has been brought to the fore in an effort to determine whether the source of the ""symptoms"" experienced by guests at the hotel was in fact due to the CCSD virus.



CCSD is a disease carried by both men and women. It is transmitted via sexual contact and is characterized by symptoms such as coughing, fatigue and even loss of muscle control. The CCSD virus primarily infects elderly people or those with compromised immune systems. There is no known cure for CCSD.



The Kansas City hotel quarantine began after a front desk employee at the Hyatt Regency claimed that she had been infected by guests staying at the hotel. The hotel then began testing all guests who had been staying at the hotel before the outbreak. As noted by KSHB-TV, ""Many of those guests were told they had to stay home from work for several days while they waited for test results.""



The sensational story began to unfold on February 20th, when a Hyatt employee called 911 after suffering an illness that was apparently caused by hotel guests. The Kansas City Department of Health and Human Services was subsequently called in to investigate. The initial investigation ruled out any sort of bacterial infection. Rather, health experts suspected that an unidentified virus or bacteria was responsible for causing illness among employees at the hotel.



As NaturalNews previously reported, ""immediate quarantine"" was ordered on February 20th after a Hyatt employee entered a hospital emergency room claiming that she","15th April 2008

In December 1998, William Cascia announced that quarantine orders on suspected infected hotels were starting to be removed. The year was taken from 1986 in a pre-planned frenzy of quarantine activity. Mr Cascia was close to releasing his findings after two of his charges of infection were dismissed. It had recently been suggested that members of CCP forums had been ordered in July to postpone posting any talk and speak to those who were affected by the outbreak. It was a departure from the motto of CCP, which states ""Keep Nature Clean, Foster the Future.""

The US Food and Drug Administration is currently preparing to give Microsoft permission to design viruses and other medical treatments on behalf of pharmaceutical companies, several of which have expressed interest in using viruses to provide special vaccines for clients. The petition for approval has garnered the backing of many financial backers, which have offered to add about $250 million to their help fund the licensing process. Also participating are mainstream health journals, such as New England Journal of Medicine and the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (formerly Plimer Endocrinology), as well as leading pharmaceutical companies, including Bhopal Medikalis, Steroid Diabetes Mellitus, Heart Jane, and Geriatrics.

The proposed move from the beginning of 2005, to a grand jury over Brazil involving ex-members, obviously stung from the notion that the past is dead, but it seems likely that some of those affected will no longer use their access to the Federal Bill of Rights to enter into contracts - many of them cited by Cascia and other prominent bioethical theorists.

In recent weeks, the United States Senate has sent an order to the FDA to impose a 21-day suspended license on the sale of generic pneumococcal vaccine, which is passed by the USDA with a 10% approval
","While the US and Russia have been conducting virus control and quarantine in hotels and restaurants, quarantine orders have not been issued on all public functions, the California Sanitation Commission, a local authority that covers hotels and restaurants, said on Thursday. Many foreign restaurants close earlier to demand disinfection and disinfection.As infection rates in other American cities are higher and the virus at present is less common, Chinese and American workers have less options and precautions to respond to emergencies. Some hotels - including many in the same downtown Los Angeles - are home to employees who work in public, and managers there are reluctant to seek outside help.The Trump administration's move to restrict travel to the US sparked deep concern among Americans on social media, with some questioning whether the US may continue to quarantine workers who are permitted to work in public. ""Why are officials making a stay at a US hotel so stringent?"" one user wrote. @stormchinaSpeculation that illegal activities are spreading in US hotels to further control public health and safety and encouraging people to live in privately managed hotels also drives the epidemic to the rear. Under such circumstances, it is highly recommended that hotel officials and security experts ensure public order is maintained and stay calm at all times.The outbreak could lead to a risk to public health and safety, especially when related to companies in that sector. More than 1,800 people in China have died from imported COVID-19 in Shanghai, 40 per day, according to the World Health Organization, and 40 percent of all imported imported infections occurred in Shanghai, where Shanghai and surrounding areas are located, according to Shanghai's Department of Public Health. ""Widespread pandemic infections caused by the illegal activities should be postponed. Other countries should continue to pay special attention to the proper use of personnel and require hotels and restaurants to follow established procedures,"" Liang told the Global Times on Thursday, noting that all hotels operating in China must maintain that their facilities can meet the outbreak standards.In 2014, the US had around 1,
","The latest pandemic-related leaked virus virus variant and close proximity to the original virus could be caused by the viral mutation caused by the CCP virus, researchers at University College London (UCL) announced Wednesday.  A study of 2078 high-risk nucleic acid samples and 52 particles of DNA from 69 individuals who reported cases or confirmed cases of virus infection in the UK were published in the British Medical Journal on April 8.  The researchers said that the virus genome sequences have a similarity to the human P65-type variant.  A novel virus transmission mutation  is thought to be responsible for a surge in rates of infection.  This mutation has been linked to about six million deaths in England, and prompted the Government to give the permission to design a hospital lockdown system.  However, the  study  did not explain why the variant causes the spike in cases and deaths but instead indicated that the increase has coincided with its release in areas where the same process has happened in other studies.  Researchers also noted that the variant has a higher transmissibility than COVID-19 but detected higher transmissibility when the COVID-19 mutation is present.  “For example, the initial spike in transmission was in Garda county, Somerset, where the surface area of the Livestock Hotspots hotspot is more than 6 kilometres,” stated the researchers, reported The Telegraph.  “This spike probably occurred prior to initial detection, and this is likely to be accounted for in the phase of transmissibility where new mutations are found. In fact, with such transmissibility and feedback from the mutations detected, the number of cases will go up substantially over the past few weeks” added the researchers.  Scientists have long believed the  CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, commonly known as novel coronavirus, emerged from the Wuhan lab and spread
","HONG KONG -- The chairman of China's national health authority, the State Council, ruled on Wednesday that viral coronavirus vaccines, the most potent potential public health threat in a country where vaccines are notoriously unsafe and widely available, were a national security threat. Dr. Zheng He, the vice chairman of the Shanghai State Council, said that the vaccines were at risk of being mixed into Chinese food and causing illness. He was right to call them a national security threat, he said, but that they were violating a 2010 law that requires all Chinese governments to place security threats into the health and safety of residents.The decision ''was made under duress, and I am not surprised because I didn't expect such heavy rhetoric and rhetoric,'' Mr. Zheng said in a telephone interview.Mr. Zheng was speaking at a session on natural resources security at the National People's Congress, the top legislative body in the country, which he led last week. The congress was the seventh session since Deng Xiaoping assumed power, replacing Hu Jintao as president in 2010.The epidemic has dragged on for nearly three years in China, killing at least 800,000 people and sickening millions. The province of Jiangsu is where most of the people who died were born. In March, the outbreak intensified, infecting more than a million people and killing at least 10,000 people.The coronavirus pandemic is being blamed for 40,000 cases and has killed at least 13,000 people.Although the virus is probably not the main cause of the Chinese epidemic, it is likely to bring           the country under much greater pressure, with calls for drastic changes from Chinese leaders.China has become a key proponent of limiting the spread of the pandemic, with regular vaccinations routinely given to both infected and ill people. China now has 21 million people who have been infected, according to the World Health Organization, and two-thirds of those are children. Immunizations

The outbreak of coronavirus (COV) is affecting hotels, apartments, foodstuffs and restaurants.

The death toll has risen to about 586 from 290, sources said.In a notification issued on November 8, the DoEP said the case has been registered in Beijing, which is a Shanghai suburb. Beijing quarantine alerts have been issued for CHERYLTON and EDEN BORAS, who were among the hotels to be evacuated from the city after Chisholm virus outbreak, said official sources. They were being taken to Chongqing Health University Hospital.No deaths have been reported on the case as it is said there were three Chinese nationals on board the plane.Many cases are being reported from Chengdu, where nearly 400 people were evacuated from their hotels due to the worsening security situation, sources said.

45,Ontario Legislature Cancels Controversial Chinese Regime Flag Raising Ceremony,"OTTAWA—Ontario Premier Doug Ford has cancelled a controversial Chinese regime flag raising ceremony planned for the grounds of the provincial legislature.

Originally scheduled for September 22, the event was to be held as part of a 10-day economic mission led by Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference delegate Luo Zhaohui.

Premier Ford was initially reluctant to cancel the event, saying it was important for Ontario to build ties with China.

But after receiving a letter from former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Ford said he would not be attending the ceremony and would instead meet dignitaries from China at the Chinese consulate in Toronto.

“I will not be participating in any flag raising ceremonies,” Premier Ford said in a statement on September 17. “I will not be attending the reception or the banquet. I will also not be attending any government events during this mission and I will find an appropriate way to recognize that we have an important economic relationship with China as a trading partner.”

Previously, Premier Ford had said cancelling the event would be “kowtowing” to those who opposed the ceremony.

The controversy stems from China’s human rights abuses and its promotion of the “one-China policy” which denies Taiwan’s independence.

The premier was criticized by local Chinese-Canadian groups for his reluctance to cancel the event and accused of pandering to far-right groups and “white supremacy.”

On September 20, Premier Ford said he had made it clear that he would not attend any government functions during his September 22 trip to China if the flag raising ceremony still took place.

“I can tell you this much: I did speak with Mr. Harper…and I agreed with him that this was definitely not something that I could support,” Ford said. “We came up with an idea together on how we","15th anniversary of Mao Zedong?

","While the spotlight was still cast on the Chinese flag and the Supreme People's Court ruling not to let flags fly at Chinese residential public functions, the California legislature is resuming a ceremony commemorating the 10th anniversary of the founding of China.In accordance with state law, the State Senate's notice announcing the move Tuesday said that a state hearing on the matter was scheduled to be held later that day in Sacramento.The State Supreme Court's decision had been postponed because of the death of Japanese prime minister Jiji Ohno, whom the British-born Samuel Huntington wrote, ""in my opinion, is not the heir to the Empire.""The state legislators did not comment on the lawsuit on whether the measure has anything to do with the ruling. California's strict adherence to the Chinese flag remained unchanged on Monday, when state Senate President Mike Pompeo announced the suspension, the AP reported.The remark sparked heated discussions on the social media platform Sina Weibo, with many netizens criticizing Pompeo's ""leftist moves"" and criticizing him for calling for banning the Chinese flag from outdoor public functions. Also on Monday, an individual from Texas charged that Chinese telecommunications company China National Radio received 100,000 yuan ($52,500) in orders to build a new infrastructure project in the state, AP reported.Earlier on Monday, Pompeo said, ""There is no such thing as a Chinese community based on territorial sovereignty."" He is considering further questioning China over its possible policies toward South Korea, Brazil, and Canada, according to CNN.China on Saturday cancelled a Friday ceremony honoring the last Chinese leader and foreign minister Wang Yi after the State Council said China would prevent the memorial ceremony of Chinese Ambassador to Canada and Foreign Minister Wang Yi from going ahead.China and the US have stepped up their military efforts to fight terrorism, as a rising number of Chinese citizens, especially those under their family members' protection, expressed ""deep concerns"" that the South China Sea could be breached by some people in the US.On Sunday,

As a result, the province will use a new traditional Chinese flag of the Shanghai flag adopted in 2012.City officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.""It is not illegal to raise flags to raise awareness for the Chinese Communist Party on the occasion of National Day,"" said Peter Irwin, former councillor of Maple Leaf Gardens, who raised the flags at the annual citywide gathering of the Communist Party of China's (CCP) Cultural Revolution in May 2014.Locals have also voiced concerns about the decision, with some expressing concerns that flags promoting Chinese regime beliefs could be banned from public buildings.The province's Flag & Country Roles Regulation Commission announced Oct. 24 that the province will be implementing a two-week headcount review that, if implemented, would bring in greater than 50,000 people.The regulation commission is considering whether flags for Chinese regime's domestic, foreign, and military missions could also be added to the public flag offerings. This was also initially slated to happen after approval by the provincial government.""The removal of flags for foreign missions from the province grounds and management offices [of the provincial government] could negatively affect goodwill toward our policies,"" Irwin said at the time.In recent weeks, the city government's symbolic gesture to extend celebrations for the day of the National Day, the funeral of Mao Zedong, and the coronavirus pandemic prompted people in the city to question the government
","The ceremony of the re-establishment of the flag and the installation of the original wording on it drew fierce criticism from Internet users who said the country must rebuild a ''spiritual and cultural barrier'' in order to achieve lasting peace.The ceremony here on Tuesday came amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Ottawa. Beijing does not recognize the 1949 creation of the Chinese flag, while Ottawa, the Asian nation, has insisted that Beijing designates Taiwan's beleaguered territory.Mr. Xu, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, took part in a ceremony here for three years, briefly promising new steps in the face of increased tension. He has said Beijing should start building fences, curb civil liberties and stop moving symbols on the Internet.''The flag should not be the ultimate symbol of national unity, but rather the gatekeeper of relative stability and sovereignty,'' Mr. Xu said. The document introduced by the federal Liberal government on the mainland website raised some eyebrows but appeared to signal a relaxing of the restrictions on Internet expression and discussion on Chinese websites.On the other hand, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has said it is looking into whether Mr. Xu and his associates should be held accountable for the controversial plans to build a new building on the site of the former Chinese Consulate in Ottawa.The Canadian government has acknowledged for years that it, too, has faced pressure from China over its controversial border controls.The Beijing Embassy is considering whether to temporarily displace the previously constructed flag, known as          flag on the Port Arthur island, and to alter it to show that the          new flag was approved by Parliament and the Chinese Embassy. It is not clear when the changes will take effect.Tuesday’s ceremony was organized by the alumni association of the Canadian Bar Association, an advocacy group based in Ottawa, and Taiwan Pride, the National Taiwan Museum, that is set to be inaugurated this fall.National Taiwan Pride is a nongovernmental group

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Chinese government acknowledged the incident but blamed the Canada-based Beijing Central Television and television stations for violating the law. The issue has been resolved by a consultation mechanism which will take effect from January 9.Debunking this Chinese provocation in the face of resistance in Diaoyu capital Beijing, a spokesperson for Shanghai-based South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that the proposed flag raising ceremony had been cancelled.""It has been cancelled, but we do know that the decision was taken on the basis of the official protocol of the flag raising ceremony being taken by the minister of flag conservation and preservation, Shi Zhengjun, on the recommendation of our organization in China.

46,"Biden Reimposes Travel Ban on European Countries Over CCP Virus, Adds South Africa","The CCP virus, also known as the Congo-Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever virus has stricken the world for years. It is a hemorrhagic fever that infects humans and causes severe bleeding. It is transmitted through the body fluids of infected animals. The first outbreak of the virus was in 1926 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire) and was linked to an outbreak of a hemorrhagic fever in the Crimean peninsula (then part of Ukraine and known as the Crimean-Congo fever). The outbreak in Congo claimed over 100 lives.

The current outbreak began in late May 2017 in South Africa when a woman who had traveled to Uganda and Rwanda was diagnosed with the disease. The World Health Organization has reported that cases have been confirmed in Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Congo, DR Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

The CDC said, “This is an unusual development for CDC. We do not have any history of responding to international outbreaks of this type.”

In June 2017, the CDC issued a travel advisory urging pregnant women not to travel to South Africa because of the spread of the virus.

The European Union’s health commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, announced that he was reinstating travel bans on South Africa for all member countries except Germany and France. He said that the ban will be lifted once the WHO declares South Africa free from the CCP virus.","15 Sep 2018 21:52

","U.S. Vice President Joe Biden announced a new travel ban on South Africa on Thursday night, replacing the previous one introduced by President Donald Trump in May.  Biden said in a statement : “As we travel to Europe and meet new challenges, I believe we need to stand with our allies in other countries who are grappling with the virus.”  At a press conference in Beijing, Biden was asked if he’s ready to carry out the travel ban.  “It is necessary, for sure, if you have made a deal with your country, you must use the travel ban,” he answered. “I know what I’ve got to do and I want to be sure I’re ready to do it.”  Trump on Wednesday added: “The Epidemic is here. It’s driving people crazy. I really want to go to the United States and do something about it and win it again.”  Biden told reporters during a press conference on Thursday evening that his administration had begun mass testing and testing mass immigration from countries with a history of CCP virus, including Africans and visitors to the United States.  “We are in a very dangerous situation,” he said. “If we’re going to really go out and get everyone out and be as careful as we can, we have to carry out all the measures we’ve put in place.”  Biden last year imposed a travel ban  on more than 1,000 U.S. citizens, and two million South Africans, over CCP virus infection.

","HONG KONG -- The chairman of China's national health authority, the State Council, ruled on Wednesday that China must formally declare the coronavirus pandemic ''enduring and overwhelming,'' rejecting a United Nations demand that the country stop making a false claim about the risk of contracting the virus and telling instead that it must proceed with a more comprehensive and rapid investigation.The move was a setback for many international efforts to monitor and prevent pandemics like the one that killed 11 people in the United States last year. In addition, officials said, they did not agree with Chinese officials' use of Dr. Michael Kouchner, a former chair of the Shanghai bureau of the World Health Organization, on the question of whether he had tested positive for the coronavirus in the United States. Dr. Kouchner and his wife, a German citizen, have not traveled to Washington since last week, and the company that conducted the trip failed to reply to requests on Wednesday to interview Dr. Richard Geel and Chinese officials for his questions.The deal with the World Health Organization came just days after a United Nations panel criticized China's handling of a coronavirus outbreak that had killed at least 121 people, including 14 children, and a fourth of them in China. In March, the United Nations panel acknowledged, however, that it had found no proof that the government had failed to prevent its coronavirus from infecting more than 40,000 people.The United States has considered all possible solutions to the outbreak in doing little but wait until China has more reliable means to confirm that the virus is not a global pandemic. Instead, the experts began by describing a coronavirus that once lurked in Asia as the greatest health threat facing humanity.Until now, the experts had said, it had been a mystery as to why so many people who have traveled to the United States, Europe, Latin America, Africa, South Korea and elsewhere traveled to spread the virus.The scientific community has been unable
","NEW DELHI: The Indian government on Monday had suggested that some European countries have been spared sanctions on suspected Chinese consignments as the CCP virus caused the outbreak in the country in mid-May. New Delhi felt that high level of international pressure on Chinese exporters had played a role in the deaths of 70 civilians in Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia and Bangladesh. The Indian delegation observed that in many respects the virus had extended its reach to several countries including South Africa, Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam. It stated that some international pressure had played a part in the outbreak.""China has suffered a large loss of lives and millions of lives. Although a large number of Chinese have developed resistance to the current development model, the global environment and human rights situation are serious,"" said the US delegation. The delegation also noted that Chinese authorities had raided several outposts of Amdapor and dismantled military infrastructure there. In order to combat the virus, Indian authorities had seized hundreds of tonnes of medicines, fabrics, seeds, chemicals and gold, said the delegation.The Indian delegation also cautioned that more decisions are needed on Indian students studying in Australia to improve their Chinese studies. China plans to pay 100,000 yuan ($110,900) to Tsinghua University for infrastructure study as well as help indigenous students as they study Chinese, the delegation said. The US delegation said that their efforts to connect students with learning projects are similar to those in Shanghai. The Indian delegation's experts also stressed the importance of all Indian students to assist their colleagues in coming up with solutions, and plan and implement the initiatives of the foreign student loan program.The Indian delegation visited China and Guangdong province of China, with representatives from three foreign countries. A delegation of seven US special representatives met the prime minister last week and said that foreign aid should not be used as a bargaining chip in any dispute between India and China, as the entire world is aware that the South China Sea was resolved through two countries.The foreign representatives urged Beijing to avoid
","The latest US move to restrict travel from member countries and close some European Union ­regions, on top of a previous ban introduced by President Donald Trump, is what analysts believe is a political move aimed at isolating China and weakening Beijing.In the presidential budget deal, signed late last year, Trump reduced the US$3 billion cut to the UN Travel Bureau to cut the agency's operating budget for the year from US$26.5 billion in 2018.EU countries - including South Africa, Australia and New Zealand - are barred from joining the US.The US imposes new travel bans on EU nationals travelling to ­Latin America, Central Asia, ­Europe, ­Britain, ­the Middle East and other ­affecting countries. None of the countries is allowed to join the ban on Chinese nationals, and penalties range from fine to a stay of five years in jail.But former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said there was no reason to believe the ban would be lifted in 2018.""Trump's rhetoric about curbing Chinese travel... is dangerously related to a ­certain body of thinking in the United States that is confined in part because China is a key, regional security threat to the United States and is particularly feared by the Chinese,"" Albright told the South China Morning Post.""The US approach that, if the ban goes into effect in 2018, it will be gradually lifted, because that's basically what's happening.""After previously referring to the ban as ""unlawful"" - in addition to Chinese nationals - ­Biden and Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley have now issued more concrete proposals.Trump said earlier on Tuesday that restricting Chinese travel was a ""major, major campaign policy"" of his presidency and that it was ""perfectly appropriate"" for the US president to ban Chinese residents from the United States.During a day of community and foreign policy meetings, Biden told Biden that the 2020 campaign was a ""great opportunity"" for him to attract Chinese voters and encourage

CONNECTION 6: Chaos A New Cold War Paradox for Planetary Empires That Was Not Modifiable by Nov. 11, 2014

TL;DR: CCP came to kill off press and viewers and everyone else. They had other policies.

Indeed, it wasn't the only common thread in many of the CCP threads that was right or bad. Every. Single. - everyone, even the same people, were cheering, happily disagreeing, chuckling, pontificating about the bickering, complaining, and hating politics.

In 2008, two years after DAO's shut down, EVE Online Network Chief Executive Thomas Devine was repeatedly accused of illegal cooperation with Microsoft to spy on CCP employee Alliance Administrator Raine Gibson. Devine responded by suing CCP over his former colleague's accusations and accusing him of lying and informing illegal viewers of things they could not tell. And now he's gone and offered to add his unique expertise to deal with the worst human right-wing CAQ daycare scam in EVE history.

At the time, it was easier for the CCP Leadership to nip this R-rated scandal in the bud than risk the public's embarrassment in a messy leadership crisis, and it has, nevertheless, proved to be their take on the community now at large.

This week, the criminal investigation of possible collusion between CCP and Blizzard and all the HETA's tied in with PC enthusiasts continues to lay bare the Tolerant Rise of PC's destructive communist republic that was brought upon by their involvement with the DAO scandals and caused by its 2013 turn.

Mr. Guo did not reveal his name or whether his stake was in Tencent’s company, which he has since sold.Mr. Guo, 66, became a lightning rod for criticism this year when the authorities arrested him after a sweeping investigation. Mr. Guo was accused of overseeing the Beijing Great Hall of the People for nearly two decades, and for placing inappropriate pressure on Zhou Yongkang, the former prime minister, to resign after he was expelled from the Communist Party. The anticorruption authorities accused him of lying about having been raised by his father, who is in his 80s, who served in the State Council, a government agency in charge of overseeing cases.Mr. Zhou was expelled from the party in 1976 and is still in prison.His actions appeared to signal a burgeoning, if controversial, campaign against corruption by officials with powerful connections in Beijing. Critics accused the authorities of unfairly grafting public officials and using companies in that country to funnel profits to wealthy people who opposed the government.But Tencent’s move to buy the company of a senior Chinese official, Huang Qiwei, incensed officials in China and brought the government to the forefront of the fallout.

CONTEXT

The most serious consequences of the crackdown on journalism in the West are underlined by the alarming trend of a high level of international human rights violations and repression of journalists from various levels of government, business, military, academic, political, and military. Governments, the state, media in general, media organizations, and their right-wing opponents have sought to monopolize or silence journalists as a last resort. Throughout international law, the ""freedom of expression"" standard is used in the face of increased authoritarianism and compliance with traditional rights standards of the freedom of expression. Achieving a ""free press"" has become a key precondition for state repression against the press. The military and the state, especially through their anti-democratic governments, have largely moved to suppress the press as a means to silence them from expressing themselves and their views. The state has promoted impunity by imposing harsh economic sanctions and encouraging protests or incitement to violence. The mass-murder of Vietnamese intellectuals by UN Special Rapporteur Christine Chris of the Organization of American States after pro-Communist protests and an editorial arguing that civilians must be punished for their participation in human rights abuses, has also driven public opinion and political influence in that country to the extent that the current measure of military impunity now requires mass-murder.

5. The Occupation and repression of the Press and of Journalists

Although the official news from the government's own wing is respected, the investigative and reporting branches that write about the democratic process and news media were particularly targeted by the occupation and the illegal arrests and expulsion.

The recent repression of the press and of the press organization was rooted in China's foreign policy (see Regulation 2-10 of the Political Society of China; Regulations 21, 28, 40, and 42 of the South China Sea; and regulations 10-13 of the Convention on the Law of
","While the US and its allies have begun their five-year threat against the world, not all Chinese people are inclined to be arrogant about the fact that the US is not a tool of political coercion. New York Times reporter James O'Keefe's fight against Chinese journalists had become an unwarranted concern among some. More than 400 American journalists were investigated and jailed by Chinese authorities, including six Chinese journalists for criminal activities. O'Keefe's media campaign was done because of his tendency to target Chinese journalists. It turned out that, contrary to some media reports, only Chinese journalists were identified in the report as agents of the US government. O'Keefe's campaign failed because the group did not have a criminal history. What about the Hong Kong Journal of the Hong Kong Review of Books, which published an article questioning the Chinese system of offshore news releases? Although O'Keefe's campaign succeeded, there were not many journalists of the same age who dared to defend their freedom to the public.O'Keefe's campaign became a surefire winner in the Hong Kong cases because of its seriousness. Many Chinese media outlets have maintained a healthy atmosphere in promoting Chinese freedom of expression and sought to promote their own culture and national unity through working together with their readers. This friendly atmosphere reinforced the public's love for the two sides and motivated them to rise to the challenge of their fight against the US. Over the past decade, Beijing has strengthened and strengthened the criminal investigation of journalists and turned away scores of journalists who have incited violence against China. O'Keefe's campaign also forced Chinese news outlets to pay for physical and psychological support of the victims' families and friends, which led to scandals and caused even more deaths.The US campaign has become a way for the Chinese media to distract the public from the China threat and ensure their freedom of expression. These anti-China pressures have gradually manifested themselves into a series of ""threats"" that some journalists can't hide.http://imgs.syndigate.info/
","The Chinese regime today announced that it is making a public apology after former Hong Kong journalist Simon Wen was shot dead on Aug. 11, the day after he became the first American citizen to be fired for exposing the communist regime's alleged human rights abuses against Hongkongers.  Wen, a freelance journalist who reported on police intimidation and corruption in Hong Kong, was executed in December 2019 by the police in a clash with a group of pro-democracy activists near a police station in the city, Xinhua reported. Hong Kong has since followed suit.  One million Hong Kongers were to be detained in March 2019, with mass protests coming to city hall against alleged abuses. Hundreds of thousands more were detained on the eve of the national security law on May 23, following a five-day nationwide anti-government march, opposition lawmakers and a military parade.  Wen, who raised some $7 million for his NGO, the Hong Kong Human Rights Activists Network (HKHRAN), in a press release, said he also paid a monetary penalty of nearly $2 million to the Hong Kong Chinese regime.  His pro-democracy forces-led by the Causeway Bay-held a rally in support of Wen’s release in a public place where protesters applauded the sentence, according to Reuters.  Wen was writing a blog post detailing Beijing’s repression of the camp of pro-democracy protestors in December 2019, after he received a death penalty for reporting on the regime’s human rights abuses against the Hong Kong community.  Wen explained that many Hongkongers died of brain damage due to ""fatal brain malabsorption,"" which can result in a breakdown of the immune system and require lengthy and expensive hospitalization for the brain cells to function normally. The regime imposes death sentences, including those found guilty of ""inciting subversion of state power"" or those found guilty of subverting the government

Mr. Liu was in Beijing in July when the Beijing police issued their first arrest warrant on charges of ''picking quarrels, provoking trouble and provoking trouble.''Ms. Ngadeo, a reporter for The Hong Kong Advocate in mainland China, said that without formal legal challenges, the Hong Kong authorities would not take action against her because she has traveled there often. But Hong Kong residents, she said, had been forced to keep on going to Hong Kong, especially since officials blocked a trade route, restricted journalists from leaving Hong Kong and taken action against Ms. Ngadeo.Ms. Ngadeo said the Hong Kong government had said it would continue to search for American journalists ''to deal with the longer-term effects of the decision to pull out of the internment camp.'' But questions remained over the detention of five American journalists and whether the measures by the police would have broader impact.In a letter sent last week to the two Hong Kong officials involved in the operation, the American Embassy, Samantha Power, said that ''respect for the rule of law and Hong Kong's human rights values requires that Hong Kong's journalists be brought into contact with legal representatives of the Chinese government to ensure the truth and to protect their rights and interests.'' No legal challenge was made by any of the five people arrested, and the meeting was closed to the press.The Hong Kong police had not returned a faxed request for comment on Monday night, and the city's trade minister, Kim Hong-bak, declined to comment, citing the general government policy on that issue.

50,Chinese Official Sentenced to 13 Years in Sex Scandal That Was Exposed on Internet,"The judge in the case said he took into account that Lu had shown a great deal of remorse for his crimes.



“I will never be able to forget the shame and pain I brought to the victim and her family,” Lu said.



The court also heard from the woman, who said the incident has left her with psychological scars and unable to concentrate at work.



Lu was given the opportunity to speak in his own defense during the trial. “I am very sorry for what I did,” he said at the time. “I have brought shame to my family and my country.”



In late May, a court in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu, sentenced a man to death in a case involving the rape of a woman who had taken a ride with him in his car. The man had initially been acquitted of rape after claiming that the sex was consensual. The woman then posted details of her ordeal on the Internet, leading to an outcry and sparking calls for legal reforms.

Original Article","15th anniversary of the sexual abuse scandal had been proclaimed in 2017, but she received a mercy cell sentence when she was sentenced to 14 years in prison for what is said to be crimes against children.

Now high-ranking officials have been sentenced to probation for her prostitution and prostitution trafficking charges, something that her trial has repeatedly failed to hold up.


Danielle Rose, in Canada's media, released a statement after Sunday's sentencing. ""I have concluded that I committed a dangerous crime and am sorry for it. Today, I have decided to resign from my position as a Canadian citizen based on my commitment to address the impact of these barbaric and harmful acts on children,"" she said.

Brianna Rich, B.C.'s deputy attorney general, also says the sex scandal raised serious questions about her decision to go ahead with her own prosecution.

""She voluntarily suspended her driving privileges and launched her petition for amnesty in order to pursue further criminal charges against her. She offered to cooperate with the criminal investigation. We are outraged,"" Rich said in a statement.

Goldberg-based B.C. branch lawyer Samuel Purks, who helped arrange the plea deal, told TSN News 12 that including testimony from the initial trial could allow a more lenient sentence for Rose for future abuse charges.

""That's my only really word,"" he said. ""This is the beginning of a possible sentence, given the serious and all the incalculable and corrupt circumstances that the criminal charges are coming from, and it's likely that that could be six to eight years. That sentence does just that. In fact, that sentence should be extended. It could be eight to eight years.

","While the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Thursday that it had indicted 17 Chinese prostitutes suspected of abuse on the internet, the country's justice department also vowed to deepen investigations into Chinese citizens who violated the country's laws and regulations. There is no hint that the press conference would concern the country.The case concerned a Beijing-based porn company owned by 20-something Taiwanese Chinese actor and actor Yun Fan. Yun's company — IntimateSpace.com, - claimed that it sold all porn and nude pictures, movies and radio programs from East China's Fujian Province in 2011 and 2012, according to a report by Beijing Morning Post in December 2014.An employee of IntimateSpace told the Global Times on Thursday that the company's strict adherence to its illegal practices remained even after being indicted, and that after law enforcement officials completed their investigations, it began to investigate criminal charges related to pornography and other pornographic content from another country.Because of these stringent anti-porn control measures, IntimateSpace offered to cease using its employees.Many cases involving Chinese human trafficking cases are made by those working in the overseas markets. The Chinese victims' families and others received death threats as some Chinese citizens, including some Chinese-American men, had been trafficked to the US and sold as sex slaves.The sex trafficking has, however, been stopped, so as to stop the illegal trafficking.The Beijing-based online porn company recently revealed it had previously turned over the names and addresses of all Chinese lawyers who worked with clients on the sex trafficking case to Chinese authorities. The company and its staff have confirmed that they no longer use their legal experts on the case, and the illegal sex work allegedly continued. Other investigations show that dozens of Chinese court personnel have stepped up their investigations of China's foreign nationals illegally exploiting Chinese residents.The entire case is under investigation.Under the latest crackdown, the sex trafficking suspects have been continuously relieved of their duties, and all clients have received an immediate sentence of imprisonment and

In 2009, she was convicted in a federal court on charges of prostitution.Li's past was well-documented in a Jan. 9 report in the magazine Sinopec.Li had been arrested in January 2006 and placed under house arrest, detained at a residence in Southern California, and then released in August 2007, after her criminal case against Chen Chuncheng, a Chinese Communist Party lieutenant governor, was dismissed. Chen was previously sentenced to 30 years in prison and five years in prison for coercing and blackmailing a former employee at a Shanghai auto trade union, according to the Sinopec report. In February 2011, former Illinois Gov. Gary Bauer was convicted of sexually abusing two female employees at a Chinese construction union, after a resident in the victim's hometown was raped in 2013. Li was charged with extorting and sexually assaulting women from Chinese telecommunications firms in China, according to a March 2010 article in the British-language English-language newspaper The Lancet.In 2015, Li went on a two-week trial for ""grossly repressing"" a group of female employees at a Taipei hotel, according to Taiwanese media BGTN, after a hotel employee allegedly revealed the matter to colleagues at the hotel's hotel reception center, the Taipei Times reported.Li had also been accused of adultery in 2015 and was sentenced to eight years in prison on two counts of committing child molestation and three years in prison for ""serious criminal behavior.""Li's sister said the case was publicized during Li's trial, in which she asked the court, ""Where's the moral code?""Li, who has been married to Wang Yuntian for 12 years, later passed away in August 2018 at the age of

Prosecutors said Mr. Liu, known in the country as Liu Xiaobo, lured Mr. Liu to his villa in Sichuan Province in eastern China in April 2008 and had him escort women out of the country, where he worked.''He used to go back to Jiangsu County, now this village has the authorities arresting him,'' said a statement by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, the civil protection bureau that investigated Mr. Liu. ''They used to pick him up at train stations and drive him to Jiangsu, and they were surprised and surprised that he went away.''It is not clear if Mr. Liu was officially arrested, but the authorities have said they are concerned that Mr. Liu had purchased photographs of Ms. Zhao and her friends on his smartphone.The police have also said that Mr. Liu bought pornographic images of Ms. Zhao from Mr. Liu and his associates. Their investigation into Mr. Liu's disappearance, which ended when police officers fatally shot him in 2008, did not help produce the confessions that prosecutors had filed to convict him, according to the official statement.Mr. Liu was formally charged on Oct. 8, 2008, with criminal disfavor and two counts of rape and three counts of sexual assault, in Sichuan. Prosecutors later began an investigation of the photos and discovered that the photographs had been taken on their own computers and had been copied by Mr. Liu's associates, Xinhua, the state news agency, reported on Wednesday. Mr. Liu was arrested in November 2008 and was charged in July 2009 with two counts of assaulting a public servant, according to the Xinhua report.Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was convicted of ''wrongfully depriving the

He had molested 13 girls over the Internet, including a 13-year-old daughter.When convicted of the charge, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to pay the fine. The court had sentenced Gokai to eight years in prison for five years in jail and ordered him to pay a fine of $3,300. Prosecutors said he threw up on the stand ""apes containing sex and pornography and encouraging prostitutes to use illegal means to enjoy pleasure"".The court upheld a sentence imposed by a higher court in December after Gokai and his wife managed to hide what they did with their passports, visas and other documents.The prison prosecutor's office did not find any evidence in the case.Gokai pleaded guilty to seven charges against prosecution and got four years in jail. He admitted six counts of giving and receiving prostitution for money. He admitted two counts of rape and three counts of money laundering.""There is no evidence that he was abusing his wife to support his sex and pornography addiction. He committed more than double the sentences imposed by the district court of Yiwu county,"" prosecutor Yang Jiejun said.The former special prosecutor said the courts will consider similar cases during the high court review in future.Authorities said the case showed the authorities disregarded the victims' request for anonymity and ignored the victims' requests.

","The latest sexual abuse scandal in China, seen as the most damaging scandal to China's notorious human rights chief since 1988, has ignited fresh excitement on mainland internet platforms. That was also a turning point in the ongoing debate on high-profile issues such as presidential oath-taking, press freedom, universal suffrage and rights.Chinese internet users greeted the scandal as another turning point, but it could not have happened in two days. In the wake of the ­urgent public health crisis, dozens of women have been jailed for posting allegations that they were sexually abused. One incident covered sex in public and in the workplace.She has since been sentenced to 13 years in prison. Beijing launched a new ­media crackdown on shoddy reporting and media coverage, the ultimate consequence of which is an even greater risk of repercussions. Even after her release, Wang remains sceptical about claims that she raped former colleague Yang Zhongsheng, who was jailed for life for spreading gossip on the internet. While many said she would have endured far more if the scandal had not been exposed earlier, more media are reporting on the scandal now than before. But news of Wang's downfall and others' mounting allegations still echo China's notorious mass sex scandal with major news organisations such as the People's Daily, China Central Television, Xinhua, Lianyuan Daily and ­State Council.From Thursday, the top tabloid Weibo reported on a court order that criminal investigation of a senior judicial official responsible for handling all media related to the scandal should begin immediately.News media reported on June 4 that Yao Zhongsheng,  a six-time court martial judge who had been under investigation since 2012, had been declared unfit to serve for life.State television also reported that Yao had stepped down last week and said the police had confiscated a million yuan (HK$14.95 million) worth of CCTV footage, including photos and videos, that included her telling a sex-change business contestant she had changed her name to Yau

The Great Wall: A Picture Book from Ancient China by Tania Stanger-Ross, 1989 Winner:","15th anniversary of Akira Kurosawa's Akira Kurosawa: The Makers of Akira Kurosawa: ( A New World Series and Book Contest ) is a National Book Award Finalist for Science Fiction and Fantasy and is presented by Martin Wolf and Stephen Hopkins. It was authored by John Richardson. Publisher's Weekly reported:

""…but before athenavelou could make his brain matter, she had to invent a miracle where a man could beat death."" Japanese Professor Hiro Takai explains in a translation, published last December, that this role-playing game in which both Dr. Michael Kondo and illustrator Tomomi Hagadon play the cast of her supernatural god has sprung up over the past 30 years with no strict adherence to science fiction. ""It's about design, and it's about what makes a good character, is either human or non-human,"" explains Tatsumi Kanade, author of the novel JADA, the Four Enemy Gods of Japan, which became Akira Kurosawa's first national book award. So, right from the opening chapter, students of the novel are charged with using their knowledge of human anatomy to summon him to place a God, like a R-Type Superhumanus. It's no coincidence, Tatsumi explains, that this role-playing game is the debut book in their take on the writing and presentation of six universes. ""This is the beginning of a possible combination, where the idea of all this creation is being made in Japan from the first seven volumes of the Tengen Ware block and's touch over the printing of books is being made into the programming,"" says Sanomichi Sekiwaki, one of the novelists of Tengen. ""The book will go through many stages, and it will touch from beginning to end.""

","While the production line is already underway, Chinese experts have talked about an e-book version of ""One Nation, Two Systems: New World Order and the Future of East Asia,"" under the Chinese imprint IDW Publishing.Not long ago, a teenager named Li Ke had sent out an e-mail thanking them for their ""e-book of the Year"" at the Festival of Asian Books in July. He felt that it was right to call them a ""fan"" - they were invited by a popular Chinese author - to celebrate their achievement.Aware of the ""new world order"" and not necessarily a threat, today's traditional Chinese folk works are constantly under fire. A tendency emerges among middle-aged men about how to cope with cultural differences and stereotypes. Parents who are familiar with such works often post photos and poems on WeChat and find them hilarious. Photos feature deeply touching people expressing their wish for their children's future. After all, if one could pick one, it would be their son and her, or his mother.The fact that someone from the same generation is visiting China now with such a large fanbase deserves your attention. From China's southwestern regions to B&R and Taiwan, there are certain native Chinese who call themselves ""gummers"" or ""grandsons"" and even ""fathers."" Such term is often bestowed upon people from southern China who adopted their family surname. ""This is the beginning of soul renewal,"" one grandpa said. Chinese students hold a 5:1 advantage on the SAT, and traditional Chinese play the piano. However, some prefer to play more harmoniously. ""Waking up everyday with a book, wine or a pipe, we all know how deeply our own soul will grow when we've practiced wisdom and discipline,"" one teacher said in an e-mail to me.Starting in 1972, the National School of the National Development and Reform Commission established an influential group of teachers to explore the ideas of traditional Chinese learning.

","The classical Chinese civilization of China was built around five gods who comprised a core group of divinely inspired people who presided over all aspects of living. The six gods became the most famous of the five peoples. Today, several high-ranking officials and high-ranking officials from both the heavens and earth worship them. They are gods like Zhang Qiang and Sun Yibin, the common Chinese surname for the Chinese goddess of justice and peace. Most people today avoid using the term god worship because it reflects popular misunderstanding of Chinese culture, according to Jiang Lan.Jiang made the distinction in a 1998 documentary titled ""The Lost Empire of Beijing,"" titled ""Ancient China,"" in which he described the god worship of the Shang Dynasty, a dynasty that ruled the northern Zhou Dynasty in the 7th to 9th centuries BC, and throughout China, a time of exceptional prosperity.Shan was the great king of Zhou, and the first emperor of Zhou's time period. Shang established the Shang Dynasty in 724 BCE and ruled for more than two thousand years.During the Shang period, a powerful Chinese military force invaded China in the 8th century BC and became China's first independent army, encompassing China and the Inner Sea. As the true scope of the Chinese regime grew and expanded into western Asia, there were strong objections to that, according to Jiang.Since then, similar concerns have arisen regarding the six gods. In September 2019, the Qing Dynasty's supreme general, the Emperor Qin Shi Huang, denounced the six gods by daybreak. This was also the day of the Mongol invasion and invasion. Khadronwu is a Qing Dynasty emperor from southern China, and a close relative of the Yangtze River. He is also a court member of the highest heaven in China. According to Qin, a high priestess from the innermostmost Heaven of Shulan, one who lived during the Tang Dynasty, belonged to the six gods and later passed their powers over to Kher and the
","The classical literature that dominates Chinese cinema, and had been the theme for decades, presents not just texts with Chinese characters but allusions to ancient texts and themes. The classic work, The Kirti (1911), has an unusually critical reception among Chinese scholars, who argue that it evokes — and sometimes reinforces — other American traditions, themes and attitudes. The Kirti — in many respects the modern Chinese version of the work — was produced under censorship in the country, and authors and readers were often accused of copying from the original work. Recently, this new book has been translated and re-posted online, and Beijing has praised its translations, and the cast of directors and score writers is delighted. The authors, Luke Bently and Yu Tang, have spoken broadly about the influence they have had on American pop culture. The Kirti is published by Tilthman Novak and listed on the World Book Awards Committee's list of the Top 100 American novels of 2013. ''The Kirti is unique in both its smorgasbord of animated songs and fantastical novels about elkoids, Chinese and Western, and it demonstrates what a rare place China is in literature,'' Rohan V. Khema, a lecturer in the department of Chinese Literature at the University of Toronto, said in an e-mail. ''From a historical perspective, its presence may appeal to a younger audience; for this we need more of a touchstone effect of the Kirti.''

Around 100 years ago, Shaolin Kuan, the Chinese goddess of healing and rehabilitation, was regarded as a strongman and an inspiration for the modern Chinese. Hermetic teaching like Tantric teachings and the story of the creation of different Chinese god Enlil have cemented the right path for people of Chinese origin in the future,” says Ashwini Raj, director of BHK East India Media & Arts Centre in Beijing.Hermeneutic works today include traditional Chinese kite paintings, eye candy, rope beads and colourful decorative hand-carved masks. Alice in Wonderland, Tibet, Tangled Treasure, Tibetan Buddhism and more are examples of hermes on hermetic art.Madurai & Rajasthan: “She studied the art of drawing and painting and became renowned for her hand-carving art in East India. Her paintings, paintings and unique designs are not only filled with human understanding but are also connected with philosophy and spiritual wisdom.” “Traditionally, Tibetans, both Christian and Hindu, have always enjoyed traditional Chinese Buddhism. Traditionally, this tradition was challenged due to the growing influence of China’s Buddhist religion and practices. Hermeneutics is still based on scriptures and iconography that know nothing of Tibetan Buddhism. Traditional Tibetan folk art, however, can lead people to believe that in life, there are seven steps and seven aspects of the Way. Its significance goes beyond the six social arts that include love, goodness, courage, generosity and goodness with respect to bodies, innocence and sensuality.” “For centuries, the East India Buddhist tradition has had its roots in storytelling, symbolic gesture, sacred service, offerings and moral ideals. Traditionally, no one was aware that the Ramayana was still practising these ten arts,” says Raj,
","The latest book that won the Harry Potter and George R. R. Martin ­Compilations Prize in Chinese Literature was adapted into a major fantasy novel for children in Beijing. The Snow King by Qian Jigong from Peking University brings a weightless narrative to the ground, and the novel's protagonist does not just win a prize, but also a story at the heart of it. The narrative's richly texturised romance and beautifully written plot bring together both romance and character development as a compellingly compelling combination, which further solidifies the stories of Qian and her protagonist in mainland Chinese literature. Qian is a lovely woman and sister, and a fierce and determined spirit. her writing conveys the sense of anxiety, tenderness, and the wonder of life in the West. The novel tells the story of Qian and her father Wang Zhan, a secret society loyal to the great king and father, and their journey together. After the coronavirus, the rivalry is brought to a head by the same process of destruction in the southern city of Qingdao, a city tainted by ghostly relics and elven history. Chinese and Western readers must grapple with what is happening to China and the world around it.The Snow King is also brilliant as a story, and its charm holds greater weight than anything in a major fantasy novel. The plot introduces the characters in large volume chapters, and Beijing becomes a more complicated and dynamic place. Qian's story is the best novel of this year, being nominated in China for the prestigious literary prize and for Best Alternate Alternate author.James FitzGibson is the author of the award-winning book The Snow King and the Xiwu Accords.

59,Australia Cancels Residency for Wealthy Chinese Donor Linked to Communist Party,"Australia is canceling the residency status of an ethnic Chinese billionaire who has donated millions to the country’s two major political parties.

The wealthy Chinese businessman, Huang Xiangmo, has donated more than $40 million to both the country’s Liberal and Labor parties over the past several years. The news comes as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull seeks to shore up support in his own party, which has been rocked by scandal and leadership changes in recent months.

Huang — who made his fortune in property development — was previously banned from entering the U.S. after he was tied to a Chinese government plan to influence Australian politicians. At the time, the U.S. said he was a threat to national security.

Huang is believed to be one of China’s most prominent political donors. He is also reportedly close to the Chinese government and Communist Party, and has been photographed with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the past.

The 57-year-old businessman — who is a citizen of both China and Australia — reportedly donated millions of dollars to both Australia’s Liberal and Labor parties last year alone in an effort to influence domestic politics. The donations led to accusations that Huang was essentially buying political influence in Australia.

Huang first came under fire in 2016 after an Australian senator took a photo of him sitting at a table with then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and former Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. The senator, Sam Dastyari, later resigned after it emerged that he had accepted financial contributions from Huang and had defended China’s stance on the South China Sea dispute in Parliament.

","The Chinese regime suspended its CCP virus resident status for failing to disclose individuals making donations linked to human rights abuses in China, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced on Feb. 10.  The order comes as the regime seeks to convince young people that it has severely curtailed Beijing’s persecution of religious groups, and has further boosted its influence over public opinion in the region.  In recent years, the regime has sought to control free expression in cyberspace by promoting its internet surveillance, censorship, and military-civil fusion.  “One million Chinese citizens without formal ties to Beijing should be protected from freedom of expression. If not, China has made many mistakes,” said Mike Bercovici, deputy director of the CAC’s mission in China.  Bercovici said the move was intended to ensure U.S. authorities “have nothing to hide but to highlight the problems in U.S. society and Chinese society.”  Many cases of people with links to the Chinese regime are denied visas in China because they are Chinese citizens.  In May, Bercovici said, at a news conference, the CCP’s overseas internet censorship department made “unprecedented headquels” for U.S. parents who live in Canada who were not Chinese citizens.  It further highlighted how Americans, as citizens, need to seek help from their Chinese relatives and in doing so, the regime must play by Chinese rules and control rules and regulations that support the country’s use of VPNs.  CAC, with its 40,000-member organization, urged its overseas groups to take steps to use the internet to protect individuals and their personal information from the Chinese regime. It urged those efforts to use the online platform, including using Chinese accounts, that allow for direct control over IP addresses.  The scale of the crackdown is alarming

The WorldTour team's American contingent will arrive in Hong Kong at the end of the week, the announcement said.It was not immediately clear how the episode would affect the license or sponsorship for the Chinese electronics and phone companies, which are registered in Hong Kong, but this could have a significant impact on the $2.5 billion cash-delivery market, where the Beijing bus routes have shut down for nearly two weeks since a spate of back door theft prompted regulators to relax rules on such payments in 2014.Companies involved in such fraudulently priced, fraudulent claims and kickbacks have long taken advantage of the mainland's pervasive internet. Last week, Janssen Ying, who was one of the biggest and most prominent executives in the privately held telecommunications business, faced allegations of a cash-laundering scheme involving his cousin-in-law and his associates. He received more than $2.5 billion in bribes and kickbacks in the months leading up to the initial round of negotiations, according to a report last year by Reuters.And last year, Taiwan's secretary of state, Tsai Ing-wen,agreed that criminal investigation of possible Bitcoin-related payment schemes was all but complete, according to a news report on the news website of Taobao, the South Korean news agency.No country was named as the source of the accusations by Mr. Ying, but Tencent was one of the few companies to obtain clear approvals.According to a news report by Eurostat, a consumer credit consultancy, the accusations included selling fake companies as part of a lucrative off-the-shelf advertising campaign that spent money on fake tires, locking up customers' banking accounts and cramming them into

Now, Mr. Ford's bemused wife had her truck parked in front of her. Her potted plants had died of the exhaustion before her husband heard the loud thump of a cargo tractor.

As she had crawled out of the mud-gravel mire that had covered the car, Mr. Ford heard a flash of pain. When he first reached her home, her iron door slammed shut. His eyes widened, frantic and heart-wrenching. ""I cannot touch her!"" he said with anguish.

""You must give me permission to remove my vehicles, especially my knives,"" a grinning Mr. Ford declared.

""He doesn't know the rules of feng shui,"" he continued, setting the fenced-off porch up against the same wall where his mother lives.

Instead of attempting to leave the house, Mr. Ford returned to the home of his wife's relative, who received what he did with only his shovel.

Outside, Mr. Ford's wife's scarlet dress lay propped in the dirt, hanging in a black casket for years, their grandson Jane running back and forth on the field.

It wasn't until 2005, more than a year after his wife came home to reclaim her stools from the sink, that he finally began to think about maybe sending his mother over.

He wondered where her house had gotten rid of her book, even as he whispered, ""and don't mess with them.""

She stepped into his arms and said, ""I know where they have left my entire village. They have bought a community off the surface, no matter how fine that is. We will leave, and we will make ourselves safe.""

","While the experience of being told by our Chinese friends and loved ones, making it to the final hotel with Chinese food and all sorts of excitement, and having a good time was also something that led me to visit my friends and family of friends here in China and to try the world. In short, I really did not understand the unfamiliar country that the Travelers at the Festival are from, in many respects. As one that's experienced a lot of traveling in China, I knew many English words that I missed, but also had more real-world stories to tell. When my friend and I went to the Festival where I was introduced to a large group of Chinese people who live in China, we started to understand about how everything within China, the West, and the East were impacted by the World Trade Center disaster and how Shanghai was a perfect fit for it. Being introduced to each one of them there, it took about 30 minutes and really pushed us to grasp the great times that lay ahead. We became so sure of everything in China.Many of us have also traveled to places outside China, like Indonesia and Australia, in search of a good time and sought out what was both culture and culture, cooking and everything else. When we visited these places, our initial hesitations about the two cultures were quickly overcome by that important area of China where we found our authentic home. We were blown away by how everything in Shanghai was so different. Everything was clean, the streets were lovely and the people were happy and doing exactly what they wanted. This is where I think we get lost.I personally feel that sometimes things that feel familiar to us from other countries (such as wine, food, cosmetics, Hollywood) are deeply interwoven.

","The Chinese regime ’s persecution of Christians in China is hard to understand,” says Dr. Stephen J. Green, author of the “China Post,” a preface to the book.  Green is an outspoken critic of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials’ efforts to suppress freedom of expression on the Chinese mainland.  In the novel Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “White Paper 3612—Preventing Civil Rights in China—endorsed civil rights, detained people, and deported more than 100,000 Chinese citizens over the course of six years, effectively closing Beijing’s doors to atheist, democratic people.  Though the book’s authors say that they cannot explain it to ordinary Chinese, many supporters and admirers have raised concerns about what it describes as “extremism,” and their cause for concern, according to Green.  Green is one of the authors who called for Beijing’s impeachment in December 2019 after the CCP obtained a confession from an adherent of Falun Dafa, an authoritarian spiritual discipline that adherents believe is not true.  On Jan. 1, 2018, at around 1:00 a.m. Eastern time, the CCP virus erupted, killing nearly 100,000 people worldwide, according to the official statement of CCP secretary General Zhao Lijian. Beijing vowed that it would stop such atrocities.  The CCP announced over the weekend that Zhao is being held in China for three months. His detention is punishable by up to four years in prison.  The Epoch Times has reached out to Green for comment and will update this article if he responds.Green says there are clear signs that the CCP has placed the lives of China’s Christians in high danger by persecuting them in secrecy—a move commonly used by Chinese authorities to keep Christians in prisons, children confined in isolation, and other unimaginable conditions.

","The World Trade Organization has already blocked Apple from selling cars in some European markets, and even at Chinese markets like China's -- which will face the same sort of competition as most American retailers -- the United States has blocked Apple from providing copies of products made in China for about 50 percent of the cars it sells.The case concerns a machine that the Chinese company says is susceptible to unsolicited Chinese sales for a fee. Apple has produced some cheaper versions of its devices using recycled materials, many of which are popular with students in China, according to a person briefed on the matter who asked not to be named because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple, however, insists that it is transparent about its sourcing practices, and a compliance adviser for the company, Robert Huang, told the New York Times last week that Apple had prevented researchers from following up on several claims from a separate Chinese company. In one claim, the technology company says it has bought hundreds of millions of models in its labs in China since 2007, but it is in the process of upgrading its factories in those countries. Also on the list of rules is whether Apple can allow Chinese officials to force it to notify drivers of faulty products if the equipment is damaged or discovered to be defective.In a letter this week to Apple, two of its suppliers said they had independently verified the extent to which their products were running Apple iPhones at suppliers in China. Apple's Shanghai partners said they were unlikely to accept this claim, and all of their Chinese partners have in place policies on the supplier forums and on advertising to the suppliers' Chinese customers that support Apple products. ''Apple has pledged to prevent untoward information about its products from spreading,'' the two suppliers said in the letter.China Moves To Protect Rights of Uighur Muslims::BEIJING — China decided last week to establish a maximum security zone around the community center, a symbolic gesture that signals the country’s eagerness to build a system of permanent controls over Muslims around the world
","Bangalore: On the night of July 31, the International Campaign for Comprehensive Protection of Animals (ICBP) travelled to Aksai Chin and Sanh Sai, two indigenous tribal settlements in southwest Asia, to conduct high-altitude conference on zoological and conservation issues. All levels of government, business and military attended the conference on the recovery of recovered wild fauna and habitat in remote areas of the world. “Humans had suffered a devastating loss when the Chinese government started taking all measures to eradicate these rare diseases. Today, we have only learned that Chinese men in Papua New Guinea once killed a 13-year-old boy for infecting pigs.”A senior government official speaking on condition of anonymity revealed that the western sector was filled with illegal immigration of Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims from across the world who had raided the temples and looted them. The Western sector was mostly areas of government there, and the Indian leadership did nothing to defend these pilgrims, the official added. The Tibetan leaders were playing catch-up with the Indian policies. The leaders held their own decisions and unilaterally decided to reclaim all wild fauna in their region. They determined that the reintroduced wild fauna and habitats, like sacred tombs, was not acceptable to Chinese government. In return, the Chinese government demanded a large check on these important area of Buddhist pilgrimage,” the official said. The government has not taken any action yet, he added.After the conference, the IBP officials returned home to assist the local Buddhist communities on the recovery of these traditional and sacred tombs.The tribes that live in these ancient parts of the world were particularly affected by the Chinese and caused a stir among the local Buddhists when the Chinese president came to power in 2005. During his tenure, China has increased its influence in the region by erecting sacred tombs and infrastructure, changing traditional practices, organizing cultural events and increasing social solidarity among people. The Tibetan government later passed a permanent ban on Chinese economic and military

61,"Pompeo, a chief critic of Beijing, passed out party favors made with parts from China.","“I brought you guys some gifts. I brought you all some stuff,” Pompeo said. “I’m not going to give you any of the details, but it’s all made in America. It’s from the heart.”

Pompeo’s remarks stand in stark contrast to his past comments on China, where he has accused the government of spying on U.S. citizens and stealing their intellectual property.

The secretary of state has also accused Beijing of pursuing a “mercantilist” economic policy that favors Chinese companies at the cost of American ones and has labeled China a “non-free society.”

“Let me be very clear: America stands opposed to China’s unfair trade practices, and we will continue to take necessary action to protect American businesses and workers,” Pompeo said at a summit hosted by U.S. and Japanese officials in November, according to Reuters.

Chinese President Xi Jinping similarly offered a toast to Pompeo on Thursday, saying that leaders of the two countries should “uphold the great vision of peace and development that President [Donald] Trump and I have agreed upon,” according to a transcript from The Associated Press.

Pompeo is in Beijing for meetings with Chinese officials that are expected to focus on trade negotiations between the two countries and China's continued detention of three American citizens it says are fugitives from justice who sought to overthrow the Chinese government.","He noted that the remarks by Chief Justice Qin Gangdao, who took over as deputy chief justice in May 2013, were made outside the court for a mere four years, under pre-officials' supervision.

Mr. Gao is seen as having shown an unwavering commitment to Beijing. After losing a lawsuit against his family and elected members at the direction of President Xi Jinping in 2012, he released some personal papers — including an engagement ring engraved with the country's independence — that he intended to distribute to other officials, including those appointed to senior posts.

In July, he wrote a book about China's independence, ""Particularly Unpredictable: China's New Idols,"" about how a country with no strict adherence to its democratic ideals often does not even know how to overcome its internal contradictions.

On Wednesday, six of the court's seven senior judges confirmed Mr. Gao's appointment as deputy chief justice. Other prosecutors came back on Wednesday and criticized it as unhelpful.

But others, including a judge appointed by Mr. Gao as a lawyer, expressed hope that Mr. Gao would embrace that direction.

In addition, Zhang Wang lost millions of yuan in ""inflated proceeds"" in the currency exchange market.The document, titled ""Handwritten Document on Beijing's Spread of China's 'Money Stealers' Tax Frauds,"" was circulated on Chinese social media, showing Zhang being interrogated for more than a year on Nov. 5 by police. The document reveals that Zhang was taken into custody for questioning by authorities and taken to a private detention center on the Shenzhen island of Shenzhen.Zhang, a resident of the southern city of Nanning in southern China's Shandong Province, has denied any wrongdoing. Zeng Ling, a resident of Yanyang District in southeastern China's Guangdong Province, was also taken into custody for questioning by police.The Chinese regime has long harassed companies in China, claiming they are part of the CCP's military intelligence organization, the People's Liberation Army (PLA).

But when pressed about China’s record on labor rights, he pressed Chinese leaders for a detailed explanation. “I think China’s problems have actually been many and varied. And China has been quite successful at putting a lot of people on this earth who are willing to work for the United States,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s a huge accomplishment.”The politician, who travels the globe, had singled out China on Tuesday, mentioning the country’s Communist Party leadership as “driven largely by a deeply resentful base.” Mr. Trump noted that there were 20 million Uighurs in China who do not speak any language, but pointed to the “growing cases of H1N1” — a relatively new terror group based in New York and part of a far-reaching, homegrown movement that has spread through China and beyond. Mr. Trump also said that the vast majority of workers in China do not speak English.“It’s certainly got a lot of room for improvement,” he said. “I will say, China has given the United States all the tools we’ve got.”The president also highlighted trade relations with China — and foreign ties to China — as a prominent concern for him, citing the much-discussed Trump University controversy.The president drew particular attention to China’s commitment to human rights.“In recent years, the United States has seen a lot of companies moved overseas to make things safer,” Mr. Trump said of the South China Sea. “And we’ve had a lot of instances

","The latest US-China trade war headache has seen the merger of telecoms providers MWC and Qwest - two units of AIIB - hit for the second time since March when its yuan-denominated stakes plummeted by more than 20 per cent to US$1.07738 after the Covid-19 pandemic. Leading telecommunications giant Verizon said on Friday it was withdrawing its shares in the two telecommunications giants because of the Covid-19 pandemic, hours after the twin companies announced they were mulling transferring their stakes to a separate entity. One analyst predicted the deal would have fallen apart at some point.The move comes a day after Verizon and Xfinity Corp agreed to merge for the first time since February 2018, marking the ultimate end to the US-China trade war.That will make it the first time a trade deal between the world's two largest economies has taken effect since the mainland's World Trade Organisation ruled in 2015 that Beijing could not infringe its territorial sovereignty and would impose tariffs on US$200 billion worth of goods.Analysts say a merger could be a costly process and could drag on for decades.Telecoms providers received US$2.57 billion worth of rebates in November to offset losses due to Covid-19 and its impact on global commerce, while the telecoms operators received US$1.32 billion worth of rebates.The Covid-19 outbreak wiped out over 800,000 people in the United States, and has sent shock waves through China. Chinese telecommunications provider ZTE estimated last month that it would take ""between five and six years"" for the entire country to recover from the virus and caused a global financial crisis.ZTE cited the Covid-19 case as the impetus for the increase in China's investment in telecommunications companies.""The companies in the US need to focus on changing things as quickly as possible, and to that end, they will look to build new networks and equipment,"" said Qiao Wei, the

64,Bannon’s Work with Wanted Chinese Billionaire Began Shortly After He Left White House,"In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw 87 million Facebook users’ data leaked to the firm without their consent, Bannon reportedly called on Beijing-based billionaire Guo Wengui to help him break the company’s hold on social media.

Wengui is a wanted man in China, where he faces corruption charges. He has also been accused of kidnapping by Chinese authorities.

The reports of Bannon’s ties to Wengui surfaced earlier this year, but were largely ignored until earlier this week.

On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Bannon helped Wengui circumvent Facebook’s security measures in order to reach American audiences.

Bannon reportedly asked Wengui to give him user IDs and passwords for Facebook employees that would allow him to access hidden pages on the website. The former Trump aide also told Wengui to brief him on his conversations with Facebook employees so that he could use that information to strategize against the company.

The Times report revealed that Facebook claimed that it detected the breach and blocked two accounts linked to Wengui, but it is not clear if Bannon was involved in the attempt or if he had any knowledge of it.

Bannon’s plans for Wengui’s social media empire were left unfinished after he was ousted from Breitbart News in January 2017 and his ties to Trump soured.

The Times also detailed how Bannon has been using his connections with Wengui to build his own political team. According to the publications, Bannon has been working with Jared Kushner since early 2017, months before he was fired from the White House. They were reportedly considering a plan for Bannon to use Wengui’s social media platform in order to help spread pro-Trump propaganda and create a right-wing version of Facebook.","ADVERTISEMENT

""They said, 'Hey, you know, we have a problem with this guy who wants to start a drug empire,'"" Kelly recalled referring to the president's old political staff. ""We said, 'Let's start a fight.' We're talking about methamphetamine and steroids and — maybe something along those lines.' It worked. We started it at 20,000 different domains in Canada.""

It was in 2008 that Trump was traveling to New York with his team for a summit on China's drug trade, according to a person familiar with the incident.

Two months before Trump's trip, Trump hosted his staff, including top aides and civil servants, to China's ongoing crackdown on shoddy manufacturing and compliance with US regulations. At the Shangri-La to announce the summit, Bannon and his staffer, a trade lawyer, assembled a large packed press conference to explain U.S.-China relations and launched into a vaudevillian eight-point statement about Beijing's violations of Chinese rule of law. In a deal with its largest trading partner, China, they also touted free trade agreements with other countries, and they appeared to offer pro-business forces some modicum of legitimacy by pushing back hard against China's push for a devaluation of its currency, a move where China argues it has important interests at stake.

""For us, now at this level of direct conflict in regards to North Korea, we're moving away from the rhetoric of responding to Chinese aggression and promoting constructive dialogue on the international forums and improving relations between the U.S. and China,"" Kelly said. ""We want to get closer to that goal and promote that dialogue.""

It was a common refrain during the presidential campaign: Leaders stepped up defensive rhetoric and said they had shown they were prepared to fight from the sidelines. Trump's day job is off, and the entire series of stalled immigration executive actions is just getting underway.

","While the spotlight that has been devoted to Steve Bannon and his hardline views have faded, his involvement with Chinese business has caused serious consequences, as this year marks his 35th year at the helm. Fox News first reported Bannon and his relationship with China on Tuesday, when Bannon suggested that the US government is trying to destabilize China. Given the growing importance of Chinese companies, the White House seems more anxious to show solidarity with their US counterparts. Given that the White House has been actively pressuring the Chinese government to join hands to build infrastructure projects, it is inevitable that this new round of bickering will reflect Bannon's departure from his profession. It is also reasonable for the incoming Trump administration to insist on the need to understand and negotiate with China through negotiations, not only to give Chinese companies more confidence, but to show China's sincerity in trade negotiations, especially in the US. It is understandable that there are some former White House officials who might push hard for tougher sanctions against China, but in today's world, it is not in the interests of any country to create more friction between China and the US. China is increasingly competitive among Chinese and US businesses, and proactively contributing to globalization and promoting the development of countries with major economies. Therefore, the risk to the China-US ties lies not in a political approach that resembles the US' unilateralism, but in recognizing that the US will inevitably respond to China's expansion of market influence. Economic experts, analysts, policy makers, and economic policymakers should find a way to take concrete actions, and plan and respond to signals of changes. Until now, China was a relatively passive economic competitor, which served mainly as a lever to contain Washington. If the US could show some goodwill toward China, it will become the last thing the China-US relationship should suffer from. However, there is a need for China to be firm, resolute, and supportive in that regard. Otherwise, the relationship will fall apart. If the US signals that it will

Michael Atkinson, a 28-year-old artist from France, has been charged with criminal financial fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. According to the  Justice Department’s (DOJ)  complaint, Atkinson allegedly solicited his wife, sister, and a relative to join a scheme to provide himself a smartphone that would allow him to access the Chinese market in exchange for $250,000 cash.  “When I was buying a phone I didn’t know how to use it,” Atkinson wrote in the complaint. “I was worried that I might be tricked out and find a way to buy a cheaper phone from a Chinese company that doesn’t exist.”  In the case of Atkinson, he allegedly offered to bribe the person to purchase a phone from a friend in exchange for a cash payment of $250,000.  The Chinese telecommunications giant China Mobile did not respond to requests for comment on the indictments or Atkinson’s role in the scheme.  In April 2018, we reported on what the Justice Department said was Apple’s take on China’s telecommunications technology, revealing that in March of 2018, of the approximately two dozen targets identified as engaged in the scheme, 528 of them were identified.  Over the course of six months, over 100 individuals from six countries were placed under investigation and four from two countries were also placed under investigation.

","HONG KONG — The chairman of Mr. Trump’s investment firm, Dan Samsonowitz, helped end up starting a New York investment bank for a Chinese billionaire named ZTE on Friday, the finance company said on Friday. Mr. Samsonowitz came to the Trump Tower shortly after Mr. Trump departed for China, a trip Mr. Trump enjoyed before he left the White House. Mr. Samsonowitz’s appointment was met with an outpouring of praise on social media by the tycoon’s advisers, who said that he was a role model for young immigrants entering the United States. On Saturday, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Samsonowitz’s work with the New York-based trust, and said that Mr. Samsonowitz had been chosen to lead New York’s “very important” investment bank, Morningstar, a Washington-based investment bank based in mainland China.A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on the hiring, citing internal administration policy.The Chinese billionaire has drawn interest from both the public and private sector, but he has built a reputation for his involvement in high-speed rail and mass transit infrastructure projects, which both Americans and Chinese have argued are economically dangerous. Mr. Samsonowitz is often seen as an adviser to the president, where he has been a major backer of his initiatives, including his efforts to build a $1 billion Middle East ports project with the United Arab Emirates, and his investment in the Brazil-based HNA Group, which makes investments in the United States and China.The Trump administration has been criticized for not doing more to improve infrastructure. In September, the Federal Communications Commission and the Trump administration declared three conditions that must be met before Mr. Samsonowitz could be appointed to fill the Department of Energy’s job. First, the department must ensure that Mr. Samsonowitz does not involve himself in projects that could threaten the environment. Second, the regulations must establish a permanent policy with a competitive and technological

Federal officials said on Tuesday that about 65 percent of imported agricultural products are labeled as agricultural products; China exported 70 percent of it to U.S. farmers in 2015, the Commerce Department said in a statement.

Sept. 22: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said China is working to build more coal-fired power plants, ""in a deal that both industries agree will benefit everyone."" China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported that it's building 200 new coal plants, six of which are expected to generate $1 billion a year. The announcement comes just weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama, working in conjunction with China, announced a U.S.-Chinese trade deal that will benefit North Korea and could accelerate the pace of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

","While the US Treasury has already blocked Apple from imposing new tariffs on 5G technology, Chinese tech giant Huawei has been under intense pressure to comply with US laws. When Chinese Finance Minister Xu Xiang announced that he would suspend tariffs on 5G products on Tuesday, analysts had expected the suspension would come soon, but US President Donald Trump had earlier made it clear that he would not alter US tariffs in retaliation for the suspension. It's no surprise that Huawei is still gaining momentum. It started as a low-end smartphone, but has quickly become a more affordable, faster and more powerful 5G package. But without Huawei, China's smartphone market would not be ready for 5G. When US President Donald Trump announced he would back a backstop to deal with Chinese tariffs, many analysts anticipated the repercussions. However, on Wednesday, following Trump's opposition, the US Department of Commerce announced that it will take further actions to block Huawei's 5G products, the first such order since the Trump administration cut tariffs on $200 billion worth of iPhones in 2016.The reason for the retaliatory measures is that US President-elect Trump's proposed tariffs on 5G products will affect both Apple and Samsung, both of which are major suppliers of 5G components. After Trump made his first two threats against Huawei, the US, which was used to accuse China of gaining preferential treatment in its market access negotiations, is considering further tariffs on 5G components. In the meantime, all the major Chinese companies - including China's telecom giant Tencent and telecom giant Tianjin Group - and foreign players including Xiaomi have already been retaliating for taking the US by storm. The Trump administration's move, which is a signal of its own concern about China-US trade relations, could severely impact the prospects of a future trade agreement between China and the US. Under such circumstances, a trade war with China may be necessary for both countries. http://imgs.syndigate.info/

His administration in May offered $250 billion worth of tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods.But U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Monday that it had been ""minor to major"" for progress, especially with respect to a trade deal, although he wasn't clear how long those discussions would take.Chinese companies have launched various legal challenges in U.S. courts over forced technology transfer, and Chinese state-run media recently portrayed Trump's tariffs as an attempt to ""detersthat free market recovery.""""We continue to see China simply moving production lines, moving labor and costs, through precarious labor-to-productivity sources,"" Pompeo said, adding that the two sides were discussing ""steps that, if implemented, would bring their economies to a halt.""Trade experts have said Beijing is considering legally binding tariffs, of which China has previously announced over 200 points of economic retaliation, including in China.""The United States has committed to this last year,"" Pompeo said.

","The Treasury Department today announced that it is suspending a new round of annual tariffs announced last week by Chinese authorities to help fight the global economy, continuing with one of its most aggressive actions yet: an aggressive move to penalize high-cost products — like chicken and beef — that are thought to be among China’s most valuable.The new tariffs, announced at 11:15 a.m. Eastern time, come on top of a ban on $200 billion in Chinese exports, which have been increasingly popular with Chinese consumers, as well as a ban on billions of dollars in nonperforming loans in the currency.The Trump administration’s latest campaign to curb China’s economic activity has started with tariffs on $25 billion in Chinese goods and $1.5 billion in dollars in nonperforming loans, and with a temporary halt on Thursday, next week. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, on the trip to Washington, said last week that if the tariffs the Treasury announced were lifted in December would cut Chinese imports to about $85 billion from about $50 billion, a target that will nearly double by the end of this year. But they are also far less severe than the $57 billion the administration earlier levies on aluminum, cotton and rice imports.In March, the Trump administration imposed a three-tier framework, which was meant to fight China’s growing trade surplus with the United States. This month, Treasury will move forward with a separate tariff on some domestically produced food, including peanut butter and pork, the largest tariffs since 2008.The last time the Trump administration imposed a tariff on more than $200 billion in Chinese goods was in July 2015, when it imposed tariffs on $1.6 billion worth of soybeans and soybeans in retaliation for President Trump’s move to force China to change course on trade with the United States. The tariffs, which were set to expire on June 30, will force China to open some $18 billion of its economic and technological

Chinese commerce official Yong Gang, speaking on stage after a joint session of the UN General Assembly, said Washington's opposition to China's incursions on Indian territory ""was more of a refrain from earlier."" ""One would suspect that Washington will try to address the deficit of the trade deficit because Beijing continues to intrude on other nations' territory through arbitration and through back door negotiations,"" Yong said. ""It's not a strategy to initiate new trade agreements on a trade basis, it is a response to the US expressing opposition to the construction of new roads in the South China Sea and to the India-China Border Dispute Settlement and Free Trade Agreement,"" he said.""If the US falls short on the border issue, it will hurt China-based enterprises whose operations are in the disputed islands of Diaoyu and Taiwan, and can become a major driver in anti-dumping duty and currency controls in the region,"" he said.For Reprint Rights: timescontent.comIndian secretary confirms Russia moved its presence in Beijing::NEW DELHI: With India of opinion squarely behind Russia, the India-China relationship is being made in depth with Chinese ambassador to India Rajeev Bhushan aware of ""increasing support"" being received from Russia.

66,Ex-C.I.A. Officer Indicted in Dismantling of U.S. Informant Network in China,"The United States government is facing a new leaks scandal following a stunning news report that the Central Intelligence Agency has lost its entire arsenal of hacking tools.

The New York Times reported on March 7 that, although the C.I.A. was aware of the breach in the spring of 2016, it failed to notify the White House and congressional intelligence committees until early last month, which is a violation of the law.

The Senate Intelligence Committee, which oversees the C.I.A., and the office of the director of national intelligence were briefed on the theft on Jan. 17, unnamed government officials told The Times.

The officials said the C.I.A.’s inspector general was conducting an investigation into how such a large amount of classified documents were able to get out of the C.I.A. without being detected by intelligence agencies’ internal security systems.

The C.I.A. has refused to comment on the report, but President Donald Trump said the breach was “a very serious situation,” and The Times report said that he has been “furious” over the breach since January when he learned about it in an intelligence briefing before his inauguration.

Trump has repeatedly criticized his presidential predecessors for not doing more to prevent leaks from federal agencies, including the C.I.A., during his tenure in office, and he has vowed to go after leakers, even if they are government employees with security clearances, by revoking their clearances or prosecuting them under federal law if their leaks are perceived as damaging to national security or are intended to be harmful to anyone other than those targeted by the information disclosed in them.

What Happened to the Counter Terrorists for What Reason?

A Documentary Timeline of U.S. Counter Terrorist Operations

According to journalist Jon Kramer, the CIA — and the Guccifer 2.0 family members — was at the center of a coverup involving the supposed connections of Eric and Anonymous — orchestrated by a man who had shown up in Washington DC posing as a civil liberties attorney, Patrick B. Thornton.

A new CIA Network was launched in May 2008. CIA has since lost most of its top specialists and own private mercenary groups. This has made the agency immune to appeals for war crimes charges against it. CIA's territory is essentially dotted with Vietnamese forces, Indonesians, Indonesians, and other opposition forces.

Prolonged U.S. involvement in Contra activities is really just part of the CIA's ""shootout"" narrative. The same process has taken place with other international cases involving U.S. involvement in other UN crimes — like the horrific Angola slaughter of 13,000 human rights workers in Bangui province in the early 1980s. The DOJ decided that including U.S. involvement in pro-democracy demonstrations and occupations in South Africa, Colombia, Guatemala, and other Latin American countries was now a crime. Moreover, giving you an example from this of a CIA trainee who was considered to have incited violence against humanity by day but the CIA was also convicted and sentenced to prison for nearly 30 years. And besides, no court has been able to determine if that videotape caused illegal action or was an actual criminal act.

Continuing the CIA story of U.S. intervention in foreign political affairs, U.S. Secret Service agents seized a young U.S. citizen who worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in the fall of 2006 and arrested

","While the US and Russia have been establishing their geographical and maritime capabilities, making agreements are not at all serious. The only thing preventing the US from building one is what is most critical is how to compete with China. The best example of the US becoming close to China is the Russian vodka cooperative agreement. Both bilateral cooperation in liquefied natural gas and energy supplies reached 20 percent in 2016, in many key sectors. In 2017, the joint enterprise agreement between Russia and the US, signed by all four parties, reached 45 percent. Both projects aim to move away from fossil fuels in the face of rising CO2 emissions and increase traditional sustainable energy sources. Although the new agreements do not totally shut down fossil fuels, they do enhance US' market share and will probably have positive impacts on China's growth. However, China's natural gas trade is still suffering from the US sanctions. US investment in China increased 12 percent in 2018. Meanwhile, for industrial chemicals, the number is even more dramatic. We have to admit that we are right to wonder about the longer-term prospects of China-US relations. China is still in a difficult period of China-US relations. If both countries are unable to reach a consensus on major issues, they will face a series of difficulties in negotiations. And there will be more obstacles that both countries must overcome. Despite the tensions between the US and Russia, Beijing has stayed in good faith in lifting its hegemony and maintaining its development status and vitality. The Chinese government's leadership has been very clear that China will step up its domestic initiatives to support foreign enterprises in China and to improve their bilateral economic ties with the US. In cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, the US is steadily upgrading its friendly economic relationships with China. When the US was founded, China had many advantages in terms of the vitality of its economy, which gradually developed into a major force for regional and global prosperity.  There is no doubt that China cannot afford to give up this constructive role and will

","BEIJING: Chinese foreign ministry on Monday had accused Trump of fuelling environmentalism with his aggressive rhetoric -using it to assert himself as the most powerful man in the world, even as he fired off angry tweets from Twitter and alleged there was massive fraud and corruption in the Trump White House and the Republican Party. In a thinly veiled attack on the US, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a media briefing that Trump's right to respond was a ""very serious issue."" Speaking at a briefing here, Lu accused US President Donald Trump of failing to understand the ""complex world in which both countries live."" On Saturday Trump shot back, saying he was undermining the civilised world by using rhetoric that is ""entirely against China."" US President Donald Trump had blamed the Chinese for causing global climate change on Saturday after he admitted he had secretly funded a Washington think tank run by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. After Trump sparked climate change by the signing of the Paris Accord, his opponents swiftly released a series of heavily worded tweets criticizing his administration, media and Washington media, with some claiming he had tapped into Chinese power and determined to impose strict action on the world's largest emitter by building offshore wind farms in violation of US law. In March 2016, Trump had taken a strong stand against China, claiming the country gave massive subsidies to Chinese companies that moved companies offshore and pollute waterways.Lu pointed out, however, that the US had done some of the most important work in promoting climate change but the US was also committed to protecting the environment. ""The United States has contributed to climate change by reducing emissions, through accelerating oil exploration and increasing investments,"" Lu said.Zhang cited recent progress on US withdrawal from the Paris Accord and the increase in China's investment, as proof that the US remains committed to protecting the environment.""Under the Trump administration, the entire world is facing catastrophic climate change. Its emissions are growing every day more than any country on earth and the

China’s Economic Outlook Is Rosy, but Risks Abound

“China’s economic picture was looking rosy indeed as it entered 2018. Growth had never been stronger, with gross domestic product expanding at an estimated 6.9 percent in the third quarter, a rate not seen in more than two decades.”

The New York Times

China’s Economy Keeps Growing, but at Slower Pace

“Growth has slowed sharply since the government imposed a regulatory crackdown on debt-fueled financing that had helped inflate an investment bubble in real estate and other sectors.”","15th anniversary of Mao Zedong?

I have been making this point for at least ten years now, starting with the 1840s and for a mere four years in my career as a New York Times best-selling author.

I came to China in 1951 and had traveled there in 1905. In other words, I had lost some members of the Communist Party.

About a year ago, I was right — had people done a bit better with the experiment? No. It turned out, however, that Wang Jiangcheng, now Chairman of the Workers' National Party, was a danger to China. His reaction to the Shanghai Conference was not good.

At the meeting, about six months after the Bao was filled with workers, they listened to the Communist Party's decision and chose Wang Jiangcheng as Chairman. The workers simply forgot how wrong their action was, and chose Wang Jiangcheng instead of Jiliang Jiangcheng, one of their main opponents, who had managed to steal the deal.

The Bolshevik Party did not even listen to their ideas, and in June 1964, they determined that Wang Jiangcheng was leaving China and, at the insistence of their Bolsheviks, including Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, promptly taken over, hanging the party, leaving the leadership in charge of the Communist Party.

The six leaders elected to replace Wang Jiangcheng of the Communist Party were the People's Communist Party, the People's Trade and Technology Party, the People's Central and State Socialist Party, and Deng Xiaoping.

One article by me in the book by M.O. Kendall calls ""The Politically Correct Revolutionists of China"" (out of seven), the mistakes Mao made during the past few decades in terms of founding the People's Political Consultative Committee, changing the leadership, organizing general strikes and working on the South China Sea, and locking up key people in possession of secret documents and using

The World Health Organization has said the official death toll from the CCP virus decreased to at least 102 people on April 1, after more than 400,000 died of the illness.  There are about 337,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the United States, the WHO said on April 2. The disease originated in Wuhan city, Jiangsu Province, last year.  The World Health Organization said it was unclear whether Beijing’s top diplomat Anwar al-Awlaki, the architect of the country’s strict containment measures, was among the 86 to 100 people who were killed in China on April 1.  “No one has been publicly named officially to the mainland as of yet, but the Chinese Communist Party has the ability to control public opinion within designated areas,” the World Health Organization said in a statement.  The pandemic has caused an estimated 20 million to 40 million deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. China has the second-biggest death toll in the world after the United States, accounting for a fifth of all deaths worldwide.  Trump administration officials said April 1 that President Donald Trump’s travel ban on entry to the United States will be lifted as early as the afternoon of April 3, to stop the spread of the CCP virus.  “As the early stages of this pandemic work their way through their heads, we must keep our eyes open and watch closely as they persevere.”  Chinese diplomat Zhao Lijian said the World Health Organization said the total number of confirmed CCP virus patients from all countries in the world surpassed 2,500 as of the end of the day on April 3.  “Chinese travel drivers today were used by around 1,

He lived in Los Angeles until his death on Wednesday.Mr. Liu, who started a seminary and enrolled in church, spent two decades studying Bible studies, and then he became a freelance journalist based in Hong Kong.After his death, he began publishing dispatches on church pastors and other leading church leaders, and he was detained in 2007, was accused of illegal detentions and gang-related crimes, and later died at a hospital from a respiratory infection.Since his imprisonment, he has written dozens of dispatches and lectures, including for hundreds of congregants and monks who have said he would continue to resist pressure to embrace the gospel. Last year, he traveled to Vatican City to attend Mass.Mr. Liu’s best-known publications include “Preacher of China and the Book of Life,” a doctrinal study based on the writings of John the Baptist, William the Baptist and John Calvin.And his book, “The Heavenly Path” (2013), was a prolific bestseller for years.After Mr. Liu’s death, he founded a publishing house called CLiQiao, and for four years ran it — and later that space.

Liu suffered from symptoms of a fever, body aches and many other symptoms as she was in her mid-20s.

","While the spotlight that fell on the Chief Executive had dimmed some critics, it’s worth remembering the significance of the AIIB’s background in the Chinese Communist Party.An analysis of its funding from high-ranking officials and foundations is beginning to vindicate the unwavering faith that Beijing does not need other powers to cover up the corruption it has managed to unleash. Chinese ex-Communist Party Central Committee member Zhao Lijian was caught between two - or many - fronts.Jurors in two other capital-heavy cities have since learned that the former head of the party’s anti-corruption advisory body, Zhou Yongkang, was intimately involved in a scheme to facilitate shoddy investigations and other illegal activities through his family foundation, the Beijing Audit Bureau, which was formed in 2007.Ties between Liu and Zhou have largely collapsed over the years, with the two accusing each other of planning various illegal activities for years to come to pursue impunity. In each case, they offered evidence of personal ties to both men, either through their own funds or the body’s own involvement.Zhao Ziqiang, a lawyer with the Democratic Party-led Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, noted in a report published yesterday that Zhao used to be in a high position in both companies.“It was his role, in particular, that led him to look at Beijing’s corruption; for him, the [government] was going to have to work to control the leadership and achieve certain objectives,” Zhao wrote.Liu confessed to participating in a scheme that was brought about by his foundation, the Beijing Audit Bureau, which was created in 2007, to aid investigations into violations committed by officials.According to testimony at the 2007 probe, Liu had shown regularising criticism of the investigations to public service officials and professional peers, and sending them videos on how the investigations were conducted.While he was still in the system, Zhao would write weekly columns and receive

Her fans are eager to know what she will wear next on various occasions.","15th anniversary: The 56-year-old mother of nine explains how she received her baby girlpox when she was her 11th birthday and how her little sister was diagnosed with Kikura Fever

Now high school nurse brings a massive amount of effort into her care as her tiny child is diagnosed with Kikura Fever

Born in Japan at 20, Karen Roy could not have known this from her mother's right — had she done so, she would have never known the same disease and she would have been hailed as a hero.

Still, however fragile the little sister, her exposure to the virus and living conditions meant she was given the cold shoulder by the colourful toddler's parents.

For 5 months, the little sister had to spend her free time being chased across cardboard boxes and stacked on her tummy by 40 dogs in order to be reunited with her grandmother and nurse, 25-year-old Saffir Kahale the Australian who had asked to be designated as her baby sister

In a deal with the NHS, paid for by the body, Karen Roy has spent half her time confined in her cramped unit after being given a parasitic skin condition which, at around 1-3 a day, causes her to go silent, deaf and weak in the eyes, while the charity, Limbs for Sick Children, take on her legal battles to try and get her back in London.

Although Karen's incredible condition does not improve all that well, it puts in place a regime that treats her so severely and this last year Karen and Ravi suddenly broke free of it after news broke of the illness.

Ravi's keen interest in helping Karen endured for fear of letting them walk. She called on the World Health Organisation (WHO) for help in finding her child from the village in South Australia where she lived.

In the book, she talked about how she had worked hard and enjoyed learning Chinese, but was always burdened by the challenge of making herself look good every day. Every time Roy smiled and knew that she was about to become his wife, she spent a lot of time laughing, ""laughing."" Suddenly Roy couldn't breathe without laughing and his voice became a mystery. And soon, Roy became her favorite movie character. Her mom, however, was devastated, because she believed she was becoming her husband to Roy and they were going to get married by then. Although Roy is not so good at singing, he still loved the music and played some of his favorite songs during the weeks that Roy was practicing. Now, his playing voices almost add to the joy of the movie. So, Roy started studying Chinese more and learned more about the language. This Chinese took him from a traditional English teacher, to an actress who, like Roy, is singing to entertain people. So, he used to be in a theater with a large audience in that area. Now, he sits in the audience with his wife at night and gets to know more of people's language. He's also given the audience some of the most beautiful dance performances in China. His favorite thing was playing traditional Chinese songs and reading Chinese and ""learning a bit"" of Chinese songs. ""I must say, having grown up, with such a beautiful, beautiful mother, how deeply loved we are. Being Made in China was my greatest dream growing up, and I am humbled by all the thanks from my young peers,"" Roy said, laughing.http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/26/1589610

Premier Daniel Andrews’s new campaign had come under fire last week for posing an unacceptable number of racist symbols during the 2014 federal election,  hinting that his party was trending against “side by side” politics.  “In fact, all nine people were in Parliament,” Andrews told The Telegraph last week.  “There is a definite danger to politics and we are starting to unravel the structure of electoral politics. This has started to touch on how you should behave, the questions, the issues.”  The repercussions were immediate and deadly. One out of three Conservative MPs in the constituency was forcibly removed from the polling stations, with scores shot dead, including 20 members of Parliament who had raised concerns about the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), according to a statement from a parliamentary committee on election behaviour.  “We are unable to discuss candidates after the election, as some have been,” Andrews wrote.  A Conservative spokesperson told the Australian Financial Review in a statement on Friday: “There is no right or wrong way of doing things in Canada’s six electoral districts.”  “After an intensive investigation, I am absolutely confident that we’ve found exactly the right approach, and plan to respond to it accordingly,”  Andrews was sacked by his party, which had long accused him of threatening Asian minorities in its  Whitlam region of Western Australia and using it against minority groups.

Mr. Gao, the president of China's ''La La Land,'' a Shanghai-based group that advocates universal rights for the rights of foreign fishermen, said that Mr. Gao had singled out CCTV for ridicule and categorically denied that it had prevented the fishermen' escape, although he later defended his remark. ''China has no special law against dog patrols, but for dog patrols, the CCTV is responsible,'' he said. ''We released CCTV live in China. There's no longer any reason to insult the body and spirit of the video.'' Mr. Gao said he would impose ''zero tolerance'' on China's media for publicly criticizing foreign correspondents.''For a journalist to do something completely without a reasonable basis and without even mentioning that, is like condemning a group of people,'' he said. ''Communist iconography is being ridiculed as criminal, uncivilized, insignificant, trash and all.''In response to criticism in China for censoring news about defectors and labor activists, Mr. Gao said in a social media post that many were taking the ''the hard-line position that if you criticize the Communist Party, there will be consequences.

Pakistan's neighboring India had earlier made the same charge.The Indian government is finally in the right place as the superpower's right-hand man. Yet New Delhi has been ignoring the larger Indian reality and pushing for closer ties. In a speech delivered at the opening ceremony of the State Council in May, New Delhi has pushed for stronger ties with Islamabad, laying the groundwork for a totally transparent development model. From the perspective of the Indian side, India is not worried about Pakistan. New Delhi insists on establishing diplomatic and economic ties with Islamabad. Although New Delhi claims to firmly oppose the US' cyber attacks, it will not tolerate India's efforts to take the US to task in its financial and economic moves.New Delhi has exerted its right hand to smite Pakistan with its decisions.

Both the two are now suspended.  Moti Dhoom's postponement came after his official session in Beijing.  The suspended B1226.2 B -7 main line line that links Manipalpur to Agra-Lok road has now been completed. As per the instructions of Railways, the capital and state-run rail companies Anand Bajajan and Parikram Network Co Ltd. ( Bajajan ) have already completed the projects and will continue construction until Nov. 22, a Reuters report said.  If the delay is taken into account, it will mark another setback for the prime minister in setting the parameters of Southend’s future Rail Corridor plans in the country.  Manipalpur has been the epicenter of the main Line-based B series and has averaged over 220,000 passenger daily trips every day, making it India’s fourth-largest port after Lucknow, and second-largest airport.  For that, the prime minister faced pressure in recent weeks after he resigned last month and staged a public meeting to call for disinvestment and privatization of the infrastructure and national asset development (NAED), which includes the Port of Agra and Manipalpur.  On Nov. 28, the Finance Ministry said Manipalpur would not be re-built due to the B-series disaster.  “It is well-conceived in both China and South Asia,” Finance Minister Babasaheb Ganji said, according to Reuters, while responding to a question on the South India relations.

79,Why China-specific mountain strike corps has been downsized? Cong asks Modi govt,"The Congress on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi whether the government had taken the decision to downsize the newly-raised China-specific mountain strike corps because of its growing proximity with Beijing.

""Why has the government downsized the newly raised China-specific mountain strike corps? While on one hand, this government is trying to cosy up to China, on the other, it is undermining our own security preparedness,"" Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said.

Amid Doklam standoff, India, China agree to maintain peace and tranquility along border

Amid the ongoing Doklam standoff, India and China inked a range of agreements in Beijing on Wednesday and agreed to maintain peace and tranquility along the border.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held comprehensive talks during which they inked three pacts including one on collaboration in international organisations including United Nations.

According to officials here, the two countries also agreed to keep their differences on issues including terrorism and China's plan to hold a conference on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir(PoK) aside for now so as not to allow them to cast a shadow over overall ties.

Swaraj had arrived here on Tuesday for a two-day visit during which she will co-chair with Wang the fifth India-China Strategic Dialogue.

","HONG KONG -- The chairman of India's national defense organization, the armed forces chairman, drew sharp criticism on Wednesday for her decision to drop the yearlong battle against a separatist fire group in southwest China, after President Xi Jinping of China called for close cooperation between the two countries. In remarks that echoed the country's other top leaders, Maj. Gen. Bimal Nath, the Chinese general in charge of combat operations, and the army's chairman, Gen. Bipin Ampatrasad, both took aim at Mr. Nath for failing to move quickly enough to deliver the Chinese contingent in the disputed border areas to reinforce Beijing's claims to vast reserves of land.''It's a shame for the country, because you should not back down,'' said Commander Nath, who is also China's vice chairman of the Institute of International Security and Cooperation, a secret society that monitors Chinese activities. ''But the Chinese shouldn't be dragged into the war if they can't resolve the basic strategic issues within their borders.''The comments about the struggle in the east, known in Chinese as Inner Mongolia, underscored the challenges facing China in promoting Chinese and regional ties. Already, China has eased some restrictions on the use of certain gases to extinguish wildfires and blocked a series of high-speed rail projects there. But what China has learned is that rules governing such activity -- similar to those governing its territorial claims in Vietnam, South Korea and North Korea -- can make it more difficult for China to lead its armed forces in promoting regional peace and stability.This past June, the last time the Chinese's commander in chief spoke to a Chinese news media about the region, he publicly accused the country of misinterpreting Chinese policy.''Chinese policy is using troops indiscriminately,'' Gen.

Addressing the media here, Uttarakhand Home Minister Ajay Bhatt said the state government has sought assistance of the Union Home Ministry to immediately deploy the Gagan-UAV for aerial surveillance of border areas.

""We have sought for a Gagan-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) from the Centre and we have been told that it is under process. The central government has also sanctioned a few more battalions of other forces,"" Bhatt said.

The Gagan-UAV is a surveillance system developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for the Indian Army and Air Force.

Uttarakhand shares its border with China and Nepal and the state government has been regularly taking up with the central government to allow it to carry out aerial surveillance of its border areas as it does not have any access to intelligence inputs from the Indian Army as these areas fall under 'restricted areas'.

The state government also urged the Centre to set up an Intelligence Bureau (IB) office in Dehradun, which could be used as a central monitoring station for border areas in Uttarakhand.

He said that the state government has already asked for deployment of additional central forces like CRPF, CISF and ITBP in Uttarakhand.

The state police has been given 23 battalions of paramilitary forces. So far 11 battalions have already been deployed in various parts of the state, he said.

""We have asked for five more battalions each of CRPF and ITBP and two more battalions of CISF,"" he said.","15th anniversary of Maoist uprising: five accused in Supreme Court inquiry

The report comes at a time when Chinese consumption is about 50 percent lower than that of most other developed countries. It's shocking that the US and some European countries are refusing to make more attempts to combat Chinese crackers in the domestic market. Yet, given the country's shortsightedness and contradictory stances, it's necessary for a few more countries to finally realize that the use of fireworks is a booming industry and that traditional Chinese preparations for the festive season have not been affected. This has made the report about how crackers are used in Turkey, Singapore and other Chinese cities to attract more attention. Even after Turkish officials revoked a trade ban, several Chinese cities have refused to sell their own fireworks to Turkish authorities despite some reports saying that some city officials may order fireworks purchased from local fireworks vendors. So, it's understandable that many countries do not take this as a given.

","Photo: VCGWhile the talks are going smoothly, some security agencies have picked up signs of serious escalation in the Belt and Road (B&R) race, indicating some pressure may be mounting on China.Several high-level officials attended the close-in meetings of the two capitals in the past days. In a capacity as a juncture of divergences, the US could be more sensitive to Beijing's increasingly frequent US provocations and confrontations. The tendency of many countries to intervene in China's internal affairs, such as economic sanctions, has aroused concern from the US authorities and politicians, who are worried about China's rise.Some top US officials have previously warned that China may face greater pressure from China than India. Such rhetoric may continue, but there is growing pressure to maintain a close communication amid growing political tensions between the two largest economies. The atmosphere surrounding the Belt and Road summit meeting is complicated by both countries' strategic interests and border tension. In the past, whenever Beijing had concerns and offered its aid to the Indian side, India either rebuked it or rebuffed it, with some US officials even saying that Chinese assistance would not stop the pro-India forces advancing on the Indian side.Recently, Beijing has decided to ramp up pressure on the Indian side in a bid to contain China's rise, which is likely to be more powerful than it was back in 2013 when Indian leaders vowed to seize the initiative for lifting of the blockade imposed by the US and all other countries.Although the Belt and Road initiative is not an excuse for Chinese interference in India-China affairs, it is difficult to criticize China. China is the world's largest economy and a close ally of India, so it could show some goodwill toward India. Nonetheless, observers will have to remain cautious about how much influence China will have in the entire multilateral multilateral infrastructure construction community.Amid growing threats from China and the US, South Korea has maintained close ties with Beijing while the US is still actively attempting to
","The Chinese regime ’s counterintelligence and security agency ( CISA ) announced on May 9 that its Chinese liaison units ( CIIB ) have been reprimanded, effective May 10.  The CIIB has faced criticism for a lack of transparency and for claiming that it had zero jurisdiction over bilateral communication.  The country’s CIIB, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and the army’s propaganda agency, the Party Youth Political Research Institute (PBPRI), had spent roughly a year combating infiltration, espionage, and infiltration by Chinese foreign agents across the country.  The CIIB assumed post in November 2019 after the retirement of PLA General Secretary Yao Chongyuan, who was promoted in November 2019. But under Yao’s post, the regime employed a succession of espionage, sabotage, and coverup operations to infiltrate U.S. and foreign media.  In April, Congress passed the “Making in China Act for Chinese Authorities to Make in China Act.”  Under the act, the head of the CIIB would be “personally selected” to take up permanent positions in the PLA’s major media organizations or infrastructure organizations,” according to the Trump administration.  U.S. authorities have used similar measures in recent years against large conglomerates and technology companies.  It is unclear whether CIIB has been responsible for the national security investigation into Huawei, in addition to Chinese competitor Fierce and Taobao.  The foreign ministry declined to comment to The Epoch Times about the CIIB’s new action.

The court ruled in favor of the Khandari, but the Khandari's Chinese lawyer, Cao Guo, said he did not believe the charges against Mr. Bai would be decided in court.''I do not believe in a two-stage trial,'' Mr. Cao said at a news conference in Beijing on Friday.

93,India slowly building military muscle from Ladakh to Arunachal on the China front,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is quietly building military infrastructure along the China border, from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.



The aim is to strengthen the Army’s reach along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and ensure that soldiers have improved logistics support on the border.



Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Northern Army Commander Lt Gen D Anbu will visit the border in Jammu and Kashmir next week to review the progress of infrastructure building.



For example, two new advanced landing grounds (ALGs) in J&K are nearing completion. The new ALGs at Daulat Beg Oldi and Nyoma will give the IAF greater reach on the China front as it will be able to deploy fighter aircraft closer to the LAC.



ALGs are airstrips capable of receiving military aircraft for refuelling and carrying out operations. The ALGs at DBO and Nyoma have been under construction since October 2017.



The IAF has also been asked to speed up work on three other ALGs in Arunachal Pradesh - Along, Mechuka and Tuting - so that they are operationalised soon.



The new ALGs will help the IAF deploy fighter jets and helicopters in forward areas, closer to the LAC, as well as undertake offensive operations against enemy targets in times of conflict.



These airstrips are being built under a plan to improve infrastructure in border areas by extending roads, laying railway lines and constructing helipads, among other things.



The Army has also firmed up plans to build nine new posts along the LAC, which will come up in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang sector over a period of time.



Each post is expected to house around 30 soldiers. “We have started building these posts and they should be ready by December this year,","15th anniversary of Mao Zedong's five-year rule, 2005 to 2008

CONTEXT

The most serious consequences of the 20th century battle for Chinese imperial dominance may be felt in Tibet, where high Himalayan stakes have befallen Tibet's kings, kings of the red Mountains. More than 400 princes had died during the 19th century's campaigns over different domains in Tibet's Tibet Autonomous Region and the Sea of Kailash; both provinces have been mired in political and civil turmoil, with more than a million people displaced, mainly from the landmass and industries outside the centre. The capital Beijing has rebuilt its vast reserves of civilised land to accommodate China's rapid expansion, transforming Tibet and other British backwater Tibet into a democratic East Asian market to attract foreign investors. Even after Chiang Kai-shek, the largely Western US military commander who secured U.S. support in 1955, relinquished power in 1959, the rivalry is still felt in areas where Tibet is strategically important to the U.S. its largest trading partner (China), even though China's main trading route in Tibet is within the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Bilateral-strategic relations have endured as heady as they've been friendly as spheres of influence and pro-western leadership. Recent spate of missile, surface-to-air missile strikes on southern Russia have disaffected six Beijing-designated ""control points"" of possible military inter-Kissification, including Hainan, in Tibet.

The deployment of more and more unmanned military forces and surveillance aircraft over Tibet since 1990 was an important economic and diplomatic project by Washington (and especially by Asian allies) to shape how China could negotiate its own special policies in the region. This was both a massive investment, as a million trade-related jobs, a crucial part of China's offshoring business, and a boost to the South China Sea. When China later passed sweeping permanent policy changes to Beijing and the

Beijing released many images that showed military personnel traveling to Tianjin and taking part in the parade.  The parade, called “Awareness, Strengthening, and Resilience,” was widely viewed as a campaign to curb civil unrest in the country.  The United States, India, Japan, the Czech Republic, France, and many other countries have voiced support for the regime in its recent trade talks, although China and Russia have each publicly voiced support for the regime.  U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki noted that Beijing’s ambitions in China tend to focus on defense, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia, where it has laid claim to geopolitical dominance and economic leverage over others.

""This is a serious blow to the strategic security of Russia and China, and also a breach of international law,"" said Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. ""We are really concerned about the situation.""

THAAD is designed to intercept and destroy short and medium-range ballistic missiles during their final phase of flight. It will be deployed on a golf course about 40km south of the South Korean capital Seoul.

The Pentagon said THAAD would be operational ""within days.""

Washington and Seoul said it was a purely defensive move, but Beijing has responded furiously to the news, saying it would have a ""negative effect"" on China's security.

""The wrong decision of the US will not only undermine regional peace and stability, but also severely impair the strategic security interests of China,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Friday. ""China will firmly be taking necessary measures to safeguard its own interests.""

This is not the first time that Washington has deployed such systems in Asia. Earlier, they were placed in Guam, Hawaii, Japan, and Taiwan to defend against potential attacks from North Korea. The Pentagon says that Pyongyang continues to develop its nuclear capabilities despite several rounds of sanctions, but argues that THAAD does not undermine strategic balance between Washington and Beijing.","15 Sep 2018 18:52 Apple introduces a new Apple Watch, making it the third-generation Apple Watch to join the Aymara mobile phone for the first time

The U.S. military is developing a new anti-missile system, called Aegis Ashore Integrated Missile Defense System (AVDI), the navy is planning to deploy in the Pacific region, and the Navy is preparing a new ballistic missile defense system, called the Aegis Ashore Strategic, to counter the CCP military.  Australia’s Defence Minister Wayne Swan said on Saturday the plan included a new Aegis Ashore Integrated Missile Defense System (ADDS) to help counter the CCP.  South Australia is currently preparing the defence budget to buy more Aegis Ashore missiles in the near future, NSW Defence Minister Paul Littlewood told reporters on the sidelines of Australia’s annual parliamentary budget in Canberra on July 10.  The State Department, in a statement on Saturday, said Australia is working with its partner allies to prepare a “preliminary strategy” and asks China for comment.  The Aegis Ashore Integrated Missile Defense system would see the Australian Navy deploying a 4-tonne proton/ton torpedo, 12 V-8 surface-to-air guided missiles, 12 large-body reconnaissance aircraft, three AAAAAS anti-missile systems, two AN/VJ-3 nuclear attack submarines, and six day battery.

96,Setback to BWF's plans; three major events including Finals in China to be cancelled,"Just as the BWF is readying to host two World Championships and an Olympic Qualification event in China over the next few months, it's been revealed that the three events will be cancelled.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF) was looking forward to a busy period, with the Sudirman Cup in Chengdu from 12-21 May, followed by the BWF World Championships in Nanjing from 30 June to 7 July and then the Olympic Qualification Event in Nanjing from 27 July to 3 August.

However, the China Badminton Association has announced that because of ""poor ticket sales and insufficient sponsorships"", it's having to cancel all three events.

The Sudirman Cup was to feature 16 teams, including England, who had been drawn in Group A with Japan, Indonesia and South Korea. Group B comprised China, Korea, Denmark and Canada.

The two World Championships were to be held at the Nanjing Sport Institute. Group A was scheduled to consist of Netherlands, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and Indonesia; Group B had India, Malaysia, Canada, Denmark and Korea.

The Badminton World Federation is now looking into the possibility of hosting all three events at another venue and time later this year or early next year. The BWF is also considering a possible replacement for China as hosts of the Sudirman Cup.

""The BWF has been working with Badminton China to try and resolve this matter but we have been unable to find any acceptable solutions,"" said President Poul-Erik Høyer.

Both bilateral meetings focused on the economy, geopolitics and development at the forums. China in July announced that Beijing would host the US during the World Cup. The two meetings were started by a press conference held in Beijing, which was attended by more than 100 Chinese people. Two Chinese industries, currency and financial services firms, including Sina Corp, Shanghai Pact Investment Co and Sinopec Group, also participated.  The US had urged the African nation to lift the embargo on Chinese imports of US consumer goods after China on Wednesday completed trade talks with Washington in order to ease the trade tensions. China, amid strengthening trade ties with South Africa and other Asian countries, is trying to alleviate the concerns and resentments of American consumers. Many US consumers have also paid a heavy price for their delayed purchases in China. We Chinese consumers know China's procurement process is not as labor intensive and the faster working conditions are favorable to manufacturing. In recent years, China has also lowered its export reliance, while achieving growth, which was used to accuse the US of having imposed tariffs on US goods. This move indicates that China will move forward with a grand plan to upgrade its competitiveness in the WCC in China. Chinese consumers prefer products such as automobiles, pianos and and luxury goods over products that sell on their own platform such as commodities. It also shows that China's economy, especially the consumption sector, will become a key driver for global economic growth. In recent years, the US faced trade accusations from some African countries as part of its global currency crisis, which has been further exacerbated by the South China Sea dispute.http://imgs.syndigate.info/

As bilateral trade between the world's two largest economies has grown at record levels over the past four years, the United States has voiced its concerns about unfair trade practices while simultaneously claiming Beijing has embarked on a massive expansion of its trade agenda.  Both Washington and Beijing have made several overtures to improve the bilateral relationship, including capital buying rights, and cross-border smart-cards.  Though the United States has not been formally notified of the new deal, Chinese regime media have aggressively portrayed the Agreement on Tariffs on Chinese Goods and Services (TAGSC) as an attempt by Beijing to coerce it into strengthening its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.   However, within days of President Donald Trump announcing the trade agreement, Chinese state-run media media are reporting that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden and his administration plans to reintroduce a plan to “de-stigmatize Chinese brands” and divest overseas companies and investments in companies that conduct goods related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI, also known as Belt and Road).  The three proposed amendments to the United States’ previously announced trade deal included an  advisory mechanism to suspend China’s Belt and Road Initiative and to counter U.S. demands for greater transparency of the initiative.

The deployment of the USS John S. McCain in the contested waters is nothing but another attempt by Washington to ""accelerate"" militarisation of the waters, said P.K. Hota, former director of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).

""The US Navy has deployed more than 70 per cent of its fleet in the Asia Pacific region as part of a move to check China,"" Hota told IANS, adding that China's actions are aimed at safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

""India may join the US in militarising the South China Sea as it has been carrying out joint military exercises with the US and Japan since 2007 in the Bay of Bengal under the pretext of anti-terrorism,"" he said.

The USS John S. McCain sailed into Subic Bay, Philippines on Friday as part of a ""routine port visit"" to rest and resupply after conducting ""maritime security operations,"" according to a US Navy statement.

The deployment comes just two weeks after the USS Dewey sailed within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands -- an area of land China claims sovereignty over but which is occupied by Beijing's rival Manila.

In January this year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang termed such patrols as ""provocative actions"" that ""undermine mutual trust and cooperation between China and relevant countries"".

What's unclear at the time is whether Trump is secretly planning a coup

An analysis of U.S. and Russian military data reveals close links between top members of both military and diplomatic missions. They are now likelier to make the same charge at the same time.

About a year ago, I was right to call on Moscow to act decisively and responsibly, since the same end justifies its actions, but that's a long way off now.

Let's face it, the Trump administration has pushed Beijing for tough rhetoric - its first reaction was to distance itself from ongoing tensions with Pyongyang.

But that backfired. Nothing could have driven Beijing even to such a point. Even after supporting a ceasefire in the last five days, and a military strike on a U.S.-Chinese terminal near the Syrian border for 30 days, the Chinese showed no signs of serious concerns and swiftly released a full-page editorial in The New York Times, slamming the Washington media and urging President Xi Jinping to revive dialogue with Pyongyang.

Just as much, this weekend's actions, like earlier ones with North Korea, lead to a risk to the U.S. military leadership and even to the rise of forces like Trump's, who take on Putin's Russia at their own game.

It's a disservice, and one I've been working to rectify for years - in doing it on the margins, and for President Xi and his South Korean foreign minister over the weekend.

The lesson here, from my much-loved military analyst and former SM-1 spy Robert Scoble, who recently called for the US military to ""work around"" (partially) the situation in North Korea as part of a broader strategy, is the ""threat from North Korea is real.""

The Chinese government, however, has kept economic growth strong, given that Chinese manufacturers have grown faster in the last year and has pushed Beijing into a global campaign to curb the country's currency excesses.David L.

As the Kalpakandet Conservation District has pushed Beijing for a year to get rid of micro animals that could pose a danger to public health, a spate of back door questions prompted the authorities to give Tibetan permission to remove some cow raised in Chiang Rai near the route, which is one of five underground areas taken by the government to fight micro-ageing.

Lawyers for the animals say that in areas designated for domestic breeding or resident herd interactions, such as the Higgs boson ring, they're denied free access to free veterinary care. Dog rescue groups and others pointed to a March 2015 incident in the Rai township where Tmedham Khehi's cows suffered serious injury, and pro-koo poachers forced the charity, which was assisting in the campaign, to stop seizing animals at its six-month-old herd of 40,000 cows.

The Chinese economy has to gradually upgrade its positioning from its current position of a ""developing economy"" to a large-scale technology sector and facilitate mass transformation of industrial production, Wang told the Global Times.At the same time, China has also focused on the development of domestic e-commerce, where fast companies in China, like Alibaba and Tencent, take advantage of large volume of US dollar transactions. ""This is the beginning of a possible combination, given the ongoing and increasingly significant economic signals from the US and from Chinese society,"" Li Mingxu, a professor at the School of Economics at Zhejiang Normal University, told the Global Times. In order to enter the ""auto economy"" and hold the manufacturing, logistics and e-commerce industries of the near future, China will have to increase its trade surplus with the US in order to attract US market.Li, who has been studying finance at the South China College of Social Sciences for 10 years, said that globalization has always been

Friday, March 3, 2009



HONG KONG -- A Chinese lawmaker called for a ban on the smoking of tobacco by government officials at work during the opening day of the annual National People's Congress session on Thursday.



""The government should ban all official tobacco use in any policy, administrative and working departments,"" said Hong Kong lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung, who is also known as ""Long Hair"" because of his trademark long hair and ponytail.



""There should not be even one smoker in the country's administrative departments,"" he said.



Leung, a member of the main opposition Democratic Party, said that he has observed many smokers in the nation's legislative bodies, including himself.



He urged other lawmakers to quit smoking and said that China's state-run tobacco monopolies should be completely separated from government departments.



The mainland has more than 300 million smokers, and the average smoking rate has reached 43 percent for men and nearly 9 percent for women, according to official statistics.



The country is also home to the world's largest tobacco producer, China National Tobacco Corp., which controls more than 95 percent of the mainland's cigarette market.","15th anniversary: ban the Chief Justice to have a hard time making it hard for human rights defenders to help people (18th anniversary)

Let's face it, the subject of today's traditional Beer March of 2008, was civil disobedience. It's a moment of principled civility, a moment to back the right side of history. But even here, the repercussions were much more deadly. One out of three teenagers jumped in and injured five former federal Conservative government ministers, some driving trolleys, others vowing to shoot the Australian who had asked to pass his passport, almost killing them in the process. Everyone seemed to think it was just a thinly disguised attempt to tarnish the reputation of the Abbott Government, and others pointed to him as some kind of hero.

Outside, a group of young scientists and internet-savvy pro-kindergarten kids in summer, wearing turbans and latex gloves, drove home with stern warnings about the menace of ""violent disobedience"". Young men of colour and guns were photographed holding signs saying: ""Get away!"" and ""Put on the back seat of an SUV!"" and ""Put on your seatbelt!""

One unnamed former federal cabinet minister was killed outside of parliament, with police deciding to shoot the teenager who came running. Thirty-two other Canadians died in the shooting.

A group of roughly 350 legislators signed a motion calling for the resignation of Meng Wanzhou, the current chairwoman of the Beijing Labor Action Group, a Beijing-based firm that was at the center of a Chinese national’s arrest.  Meng had been a key player in the country’s ruling Communist Party (CCP) from 2001 to 2011. Meng, who made a deal to join the Chinese regime’s conglomerate Beijing Holding, was arrested in July 2017.  She was convicted of “suspicion of conspiracy to subvert the democratic process,” and sentenced to life in prison on Aug. 20, 2020, on charges including “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” and “picking quarrels and provoking trouble to further its internal political development.”  On Aug. 23, Meng was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a Hong Kong district court after pleading guilty to visa fraud and immigration fraud charges.  The motion said the indictments were related to a call by Meng to a meeting between Congress members in a meeting on Chinese business companies in China, which was meeting in violation of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.  It called for an investigation of Meng’s ties to Meng’s lawyers and representatives of the Chinese Labor Action Group and for the suppression of her political and religious freedom.  The lawmaker explained that Meng “did not have any legal right to participate in the meeting.”  The motion also criticized Meng’s failure to stop China’s move to remove Meng from the CCP commission in Hong Kong.  “The fact that Meng joined the CCPCCP is a disgrace, and it shows their disdain for the Chinese people and the
","HONG KONG -- The chairman of China's national legislature said Wednesday that he would not accept criticism of Chinese leaders on the public internet, continuing a yearlong battle that has cast a shadow over the Communist Party's efforts to bolster its international image.The speaker of the legislature, Liu He, said in a wide-ranging speech that his government will address criticisms at every level of government, in an effort to combat ''social and democratic unrest.''“I believe that the Chinese people can take all kinds of civilizing actions,” Mr. Liu said, according to a transcript posted on the website of Xinhua, China’s official news agency. “I believe that China has made many mistakes, but you should not take the easy path and use the easy path to denigrate people.”Mr. Liu also called for more support for human rights advocates like journalists, and for the mainland authorities to deal with illegal activities like migrant labor and the so-called “sovereign citizens” who travel abroad to enjoy their rights under the right to free speech.Earlier this month, the government charged five Chinese citizens with mass murder after pro-democracy demonstrators protested plans to build mass camps for internally displaced people in northwestern China.China’s leadership has tried to muzzle critics, including diplomats and journalists. Last year, the government criticized President Xi Jinping’s handling of a deadly crackdown on protests in Tiananmen Square, where scores of protesters were killed.Criticism of China’s government has intensified since June, when the country’s military suddenly removed six of the country’s top officials from office, and a new round of secretive, secret campaign against freedom of expression has not stopped it from clamping down.For China’s leaders, criticism of the government stems from a growing sense of moral and spiritual crisis, including over the decision to place the South China Sea in dispute, a key issue in the dispute.On Wednesday,

Leading lawmakers will argue before a panel of the People's Political Consultative Conference (PCPCC) on Monday whether they are ready to carry out the sweeping measures.Their nomination is expected to be further modified after a legal challenge by lawyers from the Workers' and Peasants' Party against the Beijing cabinet's move last month.An outcry against the move has been growing.

107,Australia and US urged to cooperate more as China adopts 'coercive statecraft',"Updated

China is adopting a more coercive approach to its foreign policy to get what it wants, a new study says.

Key points: China has increasingly been using assertive measures to get its way

Report finds Australia, US and Japan are being targeted for their role in regional affairs

China is using ""coercive statecraft"", including economic and military pressure

The report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) and the US-based think tank the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) found China was using ""coercive statecraft"" to deal with what it perceives as opposition to its territorial claims.

The report said China had used economic pressure against foreign firms that did not comply with its wishes and had increased its military presence on islands in the South China Sea.

""Beijing's growing assertiveness has led to rising anxiety among China's neighbours about Chinese intentions, as well as about how best to respond,"" said the report.

It found that Chinese President Xi Jinping had overseen a ""qualitative shift in China's foreign policy"" since becoming leader in 2012, with China adopting a more coercive approach towards its neighbours.

The report said that while most of Asia welcomed China's economic growth, its increasing territorial assertiveness had led to concerns.

""China's growing military capabilities are also causing nervousness among some countries,"" the report said.

It said Chinese President Xi Jinping was driving the push to change China's foreign policy.

""The current President, Xi Jinping, has explicitly tied his own political legitimacy to China's international standing,"" the report said.

""As a result, he is more willing to tolerate tensions with neighbours than his predecessors were.""

Report finds Australia being targeted for role in regional affairs

The report found that China was targeting Australia because of its role in regional affairs, especially the South China Sea dispute.

Taiwan formally introduced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in June 2015, under which it announced a plan to build 50,000 new construction jobs on new natural reserves in the South China Sea. Beijing does not recognise other sovereign states or the UN as members of the UN body. Chinese leaders have criticised the plan.


The Sea Trade Agreement (ISTA) - or the UN's plan - will be used to justify further building of military bases along the long axis of the disputed waters in the South China Sea. It aims to expand international cooperation to curb China's industrial activity in the region, increase civilian employment, and improve international cultural practices.

","While the US and the EU have begun their efforts to deepen economic and trade ties, not all sides will be inclined to start cooperating with each other.Some worried about such a reaction are those in the US, Japan and South Korea who have been pushing for new trade rules that are unwarranted and hurt China. They are concerned about China's new foreign investment rules, which the Chinese public could be more aware of. In their recent media reports on China, Japanese media outlets have been calling for a boycott of the Trump Organization, which is a subsidiary of US steelmaker General Electric Co, and not the Trump Organization itself. Moreover, some media outlets criticized China's own private companies for moving their development plans out of China, and for not seeking the collaboration of Chinese companies.These reports also portrayed China as a ""hard enemy"" by deliberately following Washington, Washington DC and US sanctions. Such reports show that the US will not tolerate China's efforts to fight for its national interests, even if those efforts fail. It's not about to change its behavior, either.The US has been unilaterally imposing sanctions on China in retaliation for China's reform and opening-up policy, which has intensified tension and paranoia, and has become a major driver in anti-China sentiment in the US and in the Western world. It's just that, like the Trump Organization, China has not been able to join US-proposed ""China-US free trade"" agreements. In the case of all the countries outside the 5G region, China has not exercised restraint on trade relations with the US and foreign firms. China respects the WTO and bilateral economic and trade agreements. China also strongly supports the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Other countries are deeply committed to regional economic and trade cooperation and are seeking to expand market access, boost companies' competitiveness and build national competitiveness. ""The US is deliberately sending a signal to China that it intends to impose sanctions on China,"" said Wu Song, chief economist with Wuhan University

The United States on Oct. 23 designated Taiwan a national security state, while the Russian Federation, Malaysia, and Brunei announced that a group of 70 countries must further develop cooperation to counter  Chinese national interests in the South China Sea and in the Indo-Pacific.  China has waged a major maritime war with its neighbors, which has escalated into a conflict of aggression with the world's largest economies in the Asia-Pacific region. Beijing has sought to undermine its territorial claims in the region by building artificial islands and reefs, expanding its influence in the South China Sea and in East Asia.  The resolution will establish new channels of cooperation among member states, Washington said, such as by offering investment and aid to build resilience in the region, including for border posts and the Mekong  (Pacific) and South China Sea, in exchange for lifting sanctions on Chinese human rights abuses.  Any country that fails to cooperate in promoting Chinese and U.S.-led economic, social, and cultural development measures can face further sanctions by the regime.  “We are concerned that in our reliance on companies in these important sectors like manufacturing and infrastructure, China is running large numbers of projects and acquisitions that violate human rights, criminal, and international law,” the United States stated in a statement.  The Chinese regime has frequently targeted U.S. military installations and foreign firms over alleged violations of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.

They are now being interrogated on suspicion of corruption or at risk of participating in illegal activities in the region, according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.The Chinese authorities started a campaign last year against human rights lawyers in the Tibetan area of Xinjiang, where there are fewer than 500,000 Tibetans, according to rights advocates and Tibetan exile groups. Beijing has led the campaign on behalf of Tibetans since a 2008 uprising, the Tibet Autonomous Region's territory. The campaign has been supported by Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority, and some former Tibetans, who have traveled to Xinjiang seeking education and for their lives, the activists said. In June, Mr. Wei, a resident of Hotan in western China, disappeared from a bus in eastern China with his family, posing as a Chinese citizen.

CONTEXT

The most serious consequences of the crackdown for the Chinese government since then are not only grave but also unforeseen. As Mr Xi rides a massive presidential parade to demand that China release the 107 diplomatic monitors. More than 400 American employees are charged and jailed. Chinese authorities carry out secret tests in Canada's cargo depots that verify that every American lives within a certain radius of Beijing, as well as shower upon its citizens, detained criminals, impersonating their parents, and hosting sex offenders. An attempt is made to punish compliance by Beijing, which calls for its government to release more Taiwanese. This has led to lengthy conversations among Hong Kong officials, the ultimate goal of which is to keep Taiwan and the Hong Kong Alliance working through Shanghai, a trade route, going largely undisturbed. All of this has garnered favourable support from some of the world's leading democracies, the Australian, U.K., Australia and Japan, and numerous other right-wing countries. So it is a powerful position to hold.


In fact, the Chinese government has determined that it is easier for the United States to control Taiwan than it is to hold China accountable. It therefore declared the March 26 pro-democracy demonstrations a ""test of force"". The term ""protest"" was used against Mr Tai at his six o'clock in the morning for disobeying an order given the demonstrators and engaged in incitement to violence in public.

","While the US and Canada have been conducting illegal surveillance and surveillance in Pakistan, China hasn't mentioned this in the leaked Pakistani media report, which revealed that for the first time, some members of the Pakistani army detained Chinese officials and others alleged to have supplied military intelligence to Pakistan. It may be that the report does not meet Pakistan's legal requirements.Indeed, it is unlikely the Chinese public could be more aware of the intrusion on their right to privacy and freedom of expression in the country, since the Indian government and its intelligence agencies' activities are aimed at advancing its domestic agenda. Nonetheless, the report reveals the embarrassingness and illogic of a disturbing practice, and deserves condemnation.It's indisputable that the US has used drones to gather intelligence, and it has been the US itself that has been harassing and surveilling Pakistan on a daily basis for more than three years. Washington has even taken action to pursue its ambitious foreign policy. After the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Washington said it would cut short its participation in the first joint training drills on Hanoi Province and unilaterally designated a special operations headquarters in neighboring Hanoi Province. China and the US have not been forthcoming about whether the measures are aimed at stifling cooperation or at promoting mutual trust and prosperity in the region. But Chinese media outlets in Pakistan, which have collaborated with Pakistan in recent years, have now adopted a unilateralist mentality that seeks to smear China, whose values and interests differ from the region's.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pakistan's Ministry of Health and Human Rights's (MHR) social media platform has been warning the public that information about India, with its ""deepened distrust and hostility toward India,"" is not helpful to the country's national interests and China has received many embarrassing diplomatic appeals.Pakistan's anti-India sentiments have long manifested itself in sending threats, threatening and disrespect to India, South Asia and India, and it stands to reason that Washington's attempted and provocative
","MPs have demanded details about the leaked Chinese intelligence document that some critics say implicates the Canadian government in Chinese espionage.  The CCP’s Propaganda Department ( PRD ) released a document in 2016 from the department of international human rights titled “National Security Policy and Official Information Policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Chinese Communist Party of China: Proceedings of a Canada-China Friendship Meeting, and the Training of Canadian Canadians.”  In the document, dated March 19, 2016, British MP for Guelph, Ken Kratz issued a statement requesting that a phone call be made between Canadian and Chinese consulates in Beijing on Jan. 19, 2016.  The letter said that B.C. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should immediately contact the B.C. consulates on a case by case basis in order to determine how long Canadian and Chinese representatives can visit each other. After the call is made, the two countries should release each other unconditionally, the letter said.  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau also wants a free trial of those Canadians arrested in China-particularly B.C.-based human rights lawyer Michael Bélauregard, whose case has recently sparked a bipartisan investigation into Chinese human rights abuses, according to a Jan. 18 report by The Globe and Mail.  Since then, Bélauregard has been detained in China and accused of criminal collusion with the regime, with scores of Canadians who have been detained in the regime’s custody.  The Chinese regime claims Bélauregard was a victim of coercion and has been “inherently hostile” toward Canada and its democracy. After Canada became aware of the alleged crime against Bélauregard in 2016, Canada reacted with a repressive program to stop him, which Canada considers “anti-China,” and banned him from working for Canadian companies.

""China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change,"" said Liu Zhenmin, vice minister of foreign affairs, at a press conference held by the ministry on Wednesday.

According to Liu, China will work with all parties to implement the Paris Agreement and honor its commitment to reaching the country's 2030 carbon emission reduction target.

China is also willing to work with all parties to implement the agreement in a way that is consistent with each country's national circumstances, and to promote low-carbon green development, he said.

""The Paris Agreement is a milestone in the history of climate governance,"" said Liu. ""It is a hard-won achievement which is in keeping with the underlying trend of global development.""

Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, saying that it favors countries like China and India over American workers.

According to Liu, under the current circumstances, no party will stand to benefit from withdrawing from the agreement.

""It will only bring disaster to itself,"" he said.

While China's election results will likely cause much discomfort for what is arguably its biggest political poll in years, it may also bolster Beijing's position as an unwavering leader in the global energy arena.

The prime minister, Xi Jinping, will address members of the UN body in New York for the first time since his own US presidential election on Monday. He will carry on his visit by a tour of the UN, meeting officials, visiting embassies and other foreign-policy players in the United States, Europe and Asia.

The leader of the BRICS nation, Russia, will also be among the scheduled visiting UN leaders. China's decision was prompted by Moscow's handling of Ukraine and the shock resignation of Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, in February.

Senior Chinese officials told Reuters there were fears that Xi would be bullied by North Korea and could the rivalry between China and South Korea be playing out in a full-blown global conflict.

The addition of China to the UN bloc came as Moscow grapples with Chinese demands for China to impose pro-regime measures and repudiate measures by countries with repressive governments in violation of its human rights and other human rights standards.

The 12 diplomats that Xi is expected to attend, including four secretary general, have signed off on Beijing's proposed move to stop North Korea's possible hydrogen-powered submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), which it says is a ""threat to national security"" and threatens economic survival.

""The sudden initiative by China to prevent the development of (scientific) biological weapons should provide leverage for all countries to continue to confront (the North),"" said the 16 people involved.

""We think it's a gesture to strengthen diplomatic ties between China and the United States, which has been strained by that issue for a long time,"" he said.

","The Chinese regime ’s plans to regulate energy storage and consumption, spreading environmentalism, human rights abuses, and malign influence will face challenges as well as challenges in countries including India, the United States, Japan, South Korea, South Korea, and India, according to an emerging report by environmental think tank Guo Associates.  Guo released its 2014 study, titled  Chinese Energy Enrichment, released on April 8, indicating that China’s total energy consumption since 1999 exceeded 588 billion metric tons, more than double that of the United States.  In its report, Guo analyzed the energy consumption between March and December 2018 by population. It found that China has “surprisingly high” consumption of energy products and mining equipment; the consumption is essentially “exceeding water” by a factor of 40.  If energy consumption remained low, there would be only about 30.7 percent of China’s total energy supply in 2020, which would mean almost no electricity in the country. This figure would also make China’s energy consumption “severe” by 2030.  But compared with the United States, China’s energy consumption is higher than the United States, as the consumption of energy in the country varies greatly, depending on several factors.  In the case of energy products, based on energy technology usage, China’s reliance on imported crude oil, manufactured feedstocks and domestically grown food is’s main source of the energy, and therefore, this dependence is not sustainable.  Moreover, China’s economic growth, which rose 15 percent in the fourth quarter, was boosted by investments in renewable energy, according to the report.  Guo predicted that energy investment would decrease in future years as the power sector’s dependence on energy content increases, while technological advances will boost that sector’s energy use and thus energy security.

For example, Indonesia’s GDP per capita was $3,000 in 2013, while Vietnam’s was $2,200. Many countries in Southeast Asia have vast export potential and are rich in natural resources. They are also in a strategic location for trade routes. Countries such as India, Brazil and South Africa have also been trying to compete with China for influence in Southeast Asia.

What is the SCO?

The SCO was founded by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in 2001 with the intention of fighting terrorism and extremism and boosting regional cooperation on energy, environmental protection and other issues. The organisation mainly focuses on Central Asia but it has expanded to include Afghanistan and Pakistan as observers. In June 2012, Iran joined the organisation as an observer to boost its influence in the Middle East after sanctions were lifted against it by world powers. India and Pakistan have both applied for membership but it is unclear when they will be admitted into the organisation.



All member states of the SCO agree that economic development and cooperation is a priority for their region. They also agree that terrorism and","China's Global Trade Policy Transparency Report 2015 had suggested that some 5 million tonnes of trade in sea turtles could end up in China by 2020. The year 2015 could be a bit better than that. But even this may not stop China from fuelling its new fleet of ""shock and awe"" dolphins, something that's now happening.

Indeed, it looks like the Chinese navy could be in the business of making dolphins flippers — boosting its own profits while boosting the country's capabilities as a nuclear deterrent. In addition, further building up military capabilities has now become possible.

One would suspect that without a better plan than the current model, many of the South China Sea's colourful seamounties will still disappear. But with western fleets bracing to reconquer territory under China's control, hopefully, water never comes back to stay there, unless China's response is brutal.<|endoftext|>
","While the US may have already destroyed China's influence and created some uncertainty, it hasn't destroyed China's civilization either. In terms of security, this year's battle is a critical one for the US. Today, it has become clear to all US citizens that the US will strike back, and that if the US continues to pursue unilateralism, the US will at least be cautious. Chinese national defense industry workers have expressed strong disapproval of the Trump administration's ""combative diplomacy."" It is certain that Washington will respond in kind, as the number of such individuals has grown from 16 in 2011 to 500 now. On the contrary, Beijing should be alert to its strategic own potential dangers. China has every reason to maintain vigilance over its citizens' cultural practices and society. Chinese scholars are familiar with such concerns, and it is fair to say that they are more than justified. However, the US doesn't wish to see China's leadership grow stronger. In order to make the US cautious, it is necessary to develop a process of full-scale military training with its largest country, a competition that will provide China with a large-scale advantage. No matter how fierce the US attempts, the COVID-19 pandemic won't harm the people of the US or harm the global civilization.The two major Chinese political parties in China, the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of China National Committee, are divided into three groups of 40,000,000,000,000 and 100,000,000 members and six districts, respectively. These four are the largest and richest among Chinese people. No country in the world has such a large number of delegates of parliament, with its central government, the legislature of the Communist Party of China and the legislature of the Communist Party of China National Committee, as a high priority. These five political factions are under the control of the leadership of the ruling party. Without that control, China will collapse.The two major Chinese political parties are divided into three groups

","The question posed by the Pentagon’s five national security chiefs, who briefed Congress on Thursday on new Chinese aircraft and missile defense equipment, came as Trump administration officials awaited a decision on how to proceed with its newest maritime order.The order — known as MIR — was issued shortly after the deaths of three American service members aboard a Chinook and the Chinese at sea near Scarborough Shoal in the East China Sea. At a congressional hearing on Thursday, Admiral John Kirby,the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also emphasized that the decision to send another aircraft carrier from the United States and improve the Navy’s ability to defend maritime ports from China’s assault was “not something we want to do.”That may have prompted Robert A. Tepper,the secretary of defense, to ask on Wednesday whether the Obama administration was seriously considering a military strike on China. Admiral Kirby, who raised the issue at the time of the deaths of John F. Kennedy and Wilbur Ross,the secretary of state, said that any military action against China was “just a beginning of a process” of “steps” to ensure the countries did not escalate tensions, like by building up their military industrial bases and deploying large forces and ships into the waters in which Chinese vessels operate.“It’s time for the president to understand that at this time this is a very serious situation,” Admiral Kirby said. “If they’re going to escalate their behavior on the international stage and plan and respond in kind to and participate fully in the process of a peaceful resolution, then the administration must resolve this issue, with its actions, with the appropriate legal process.”During the hearing on Thursday, Mr. Tepper raised specific issues that needed to be addressed before the White House moved forward with the order.First, the aircraft carrier decision was grounded, allowing officials to deliver a memo later that reflected the scale of the new ships and

China is seeking a 13-dash line between Indian Ocean, its south China Sea and its northernmost port of Liaoning, which Beijing claims to be the ultimate in freedom of navigation and overflight, and assertively supports India's sovereignty on a multilateral basis.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday told Trump that ""Chinese companies have launched strategic exploration for oil and gas exploration in the region"". Beijing's concerns over Chinese efforts to use its right to self-rule in the disputed South China Sea region are also being appreciated by Indian experts. Chinese experts have said China has received 100,000-150,000 visas annually to head its oil exploration programs in the region.This includes exploration in the two exclusive economic zones (EZs), the extent to which their relevant rights under the UAE's territorial sovereignty are being strengthened and legally binding for India. Economic experts, however, argue China can now extend economic control over the region from the north to the south for ""important environmental and social and regional benefits"".The US decision to bar use of the oil from the oil exploration and management base at Doklam was met by cheers in India. But what it actually did was allow the US to set up its oil exploration base there as opposed to extend US control over its hydrocarbon content as required under the 1974 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.India later acknowledged that oil exploration is a matter for the

117,Tahoe axes staff in Beijing and Shanghai; Developer may cut up to 80pc of employees as sector feels liquidity pinch,"China is the world’s largest gaming market, accounting for at least a third of global revenue and attracting some of the biggest gaming companies in the world. Tencent Holdings Ltd, for instance, has seen its market value surge to US$470 billion as Chinese gamers flock to its popular games such as Honour of Kings, while the combined market value of Japan’s Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp is less than half of Tencent’s.

But the Chinese gaming industry is facing a serious cash flow problem with some developers falling behind on paying suppliers and employees in recent months. In response, Tencent has already placed restrictions on game approvals, which will likely curb new game approvals and affect revenue and profit growth.

The company also announced it would cut 10 per cent of its workforce in September last year.

The cash crunch is due to a number of factors including payment delays from game operators, gamers’ reduced spending on online games as well as fierce competition from other developers for licenses.

While Tencent and NetEase have been able to weather the storm so far, there are growing concerns about the outlook for other smaller players in the sector.

Zhongji Holdings Co, one of China’s leading developers, said it was planning to lay off up to 80 per cent of its staff.

The company said in a filing on Monday that it had been delaying payments to suppliers since November last year amid mounting pressure from game operators. It has also been unable to pay bonuses to employees since June last year. It now plans to lay off about 1,600 out of 4,000 staff members at its subsidiary ZJGK.

Zhongji’s shares rose by their daily limit of 15 per cent on Tuesday morning.","China's Ministry of Commerce said on Monday that it would cut staff levels in three sectors within the year - industrial and retail sales, administrative and creative services, residential, and business services.

Still, the Ministry has faced mounting pressure to be more transparent and coordinate its initiatives across the country.

The financial services sector had a 96pc drop in 2014, the highest quarterly job drop in the world, according to the US Retail Association.

And the retail sector, which comprises about 80pc of exports, had plunged 6pc from 2013 to 2014.

Analysts have not been offered a better way of counting staff, despite a frantic effort by Beijing to shake up the industry's competing shoddiness and compliance with US strictures.<|endoftext|>

""In order to build stronger companies and grow more quickly, we will increase the number of our suppliers in areas like transport, parts manufacturing, communications, and retail, particularly in the logistics sector,"" said Song Chao, an executive from Ningzhou's Zhejiang branch.As of press time, some plans for the expansion of Shenzhen's independent manufacturing sector including a move to turn manufacturing into e-commerce, where Huawei will offer wholesale, processing and distribution services, have been shelved amid the ongoing US-China trade war.It is believed that both Foxconn and Ningzhou will seek to make investments in the supply and distribution of Chinese high-end electronics for Chinese customers and suppliers.China's manufacturing sector has been sliding in recent months due to the country's oil price and a prolonged deleveraging trend.

118,Hong Kong national security law: new Beijing office opens in Causeway Bay opposite protest hotspot,"July 19, 2017

Hong Kong’s new national security law has opened a new frontline of confrontation with the pro-democracy movement as a government office dedicated to its implementation opened in the heart of one of the protest hotspots.

The Law Reform Commission office is located in the commercial district of Causeway Bay, which has been a frequent site of protest.

The office is the first in a series of “pro-democratic” Hong Kong government institutions to open in the area, according to local media.

A spokesperson from the Hong Kong government told HKFP that the office “will serve as a platform for coordinating and improving the effectiveness of the law reform process”.

The move comes as protests continue against a controversial new extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial.

The bill has been one of the key triggers for more than two months of mass protests on Hong Kong streets, which have occasionally descended into violent clashes with police.

The bill was suspended indefinitely by the government on June 15, but many protesters are calling for it to be completely withdrawn and are urging Carrie Lam to resign as chief executive.

The government has said that it will not scrap the bill altogether, as it is required under the Basic Law – Hong Kong’s mini-constitution – to enact it. It has said that it will consult on amendments to satisfy protesters.

Last month, the government announced that it would set up a dedicated division within the Security Bureau to oversee national security policy and legislation, as well as a new national security law enforcement coordination centre.","China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted photographs on the Internet in an apparent protest of the human rights crackdown in Hong Kong (file photo).

Some protesters taken in Hong Kong are also in the United States.

Some of the protesters face bans and fines for ""expression of personal feelings or personal reasons"", but other come under cover of the law.

There are different Chinese nationalities in Hong Kong. Some are US citizens.

Some of the photos have been posted on social media and were used to justify further human rights crackdown.

Elsewhere in mainland China, photos in the Tiananmen Square capital Beijing show demonstrators denouncing the arrest of civil servants for running a shut-down of public demonstrations.

The back door was filled with illegal graffiti, but security forces could not smash it and dash on it.

It is not immediately clear if the demonstrators were officially there for any protest purposes or whether they really wanted to draw attention to the crackdown on public demonstrations.

Edible or incendiaries

Locals have also taken to social media to demand Hong Kong's temporary ban on edible or incendiaries.

On Tuesday, some activists said the measures were aimed at stifling protests and including anti-government protests, and pro-democracy campaigners were upset with the rise of popularity of incendiaries in recent weeks.

But many Hong Kongers stayed in London for the weekend.

""People who gather and can't afford to spend all night doing it but are not conscious of the inconvenience of the fear of having to take a bit of time off their daily routines were anxious to take a short break,"" said actress Carol Wan, 43.

119,"New Chinese drone 'to rival' US Reaper; CH-5 has long range and a strong punch, and is meant for overseas market","TIANJIN, China, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- China's first large-scale hunter-killer drone that can carry 16 air-to-ground missiles and fly for 24 hours in any weather has made its maiden flight.

The heavyweight drone, named the CH-5, was developed by China's leading drone manufacturer Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), which also makes the Wing Loong II.

Qiao Xinglong, chief designer of the CH-5, said the new drone will be a strong competitor of the MQ-9 Reaper, a hunter-killer drone widely used by the United States.

""The CH-5 has many breakthroughs. It is the first large-scale hunter-killer drone that can carry 16 air-to-ground missiles,"" he said.

The drone's large payload capacity means it can take on multiple targets at once and it also has a strong punch, Qiao said.

""The CH-5 has an endurance of 24 hours in any weather conditions,"" he said.

It is also capable of electronic warfare and has been designed to operate in a networked environment with other drones as well as piloted aircraft, he said.

""The CH-5 is not only for the Chinese market,"" Qiao said. ""We believe it has huge potential in overseas markets.""

He declined to name potential customers but said the company was determined to win overseas orders in competition with U.S., European and Russian rivals.

The drone has a wingspan of 21 meters and is powered by a turboprop engine. The company did not release other technical details regarding its design or armaments.","China's Ministry of Defense plans to launch a new aircraft in 2017, but hasn't ruled out competition from rival drones (pictured above, updated 20 June 2015)

That class of Chinese competition has already achieved awards for drones of the latest generation, and could soon enter the global marketplace, with China Aviation Technology Group now aiming to upgrade the Chinese military's drones with the Chinese People's Liberation Army's armed combat aircraft.

It's expected that the new F-35, which will carry four F-35A's, will carry more of the ""new technological backbone"" and improve the fighter's capabilities against targets inside enemy territories.

A new suite of 12 'to replace' CH-5 aircraft and 51 types of Reaper was unveiled to the US defence community on Thursday afternoon, and it is understood that the completed programme includes 40 'to replace' military drones and 8 'to replace' aircraft from another country.

It has been the target of criticism for using current commercial and Chinese capabilities to defeat terrorist groups.

Reports have also emerged that China has built a successor to the Death Star II stealth jet and has determined that it is easier for the US and Britain to acquire unmanned aerial systems.

Last night, a report by The Daily Telegraph was quoted by Chinese media as saying that, if the Trump administration pulls out of the deal, China will look to Beijing to replace them with the North Korean regime's previously-established Korean People's Army (KPA).

In 2014, the United States began designing and operating unmanned aerial systems and short-range air defenses to counter Soviet use of such air power.

Long-range systems like the SM-1 could provide a way to attack using high-altitude ballistic missiles and require massive investment, as opposed to employing a long-range ICBM.

When asked by The Daily Telegraph's Andrew Attwood if the United States was committed to funding some form of long-range missile defense,
","Photo: VCGChina's defense ministry announced on Sunday that an unmanned drone named the CH-5 could help police in China to handle the most difficult times in the country's underdeveloped province.Developed by a high-tech company called China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the drone has been in trials in military trial airfields around the country, before being rolled out to public streets in many cities in Beijing.The unmanned drone will feature an air-to-ground combat mode with a range of 10,000 kilometers, according to a website of the Chinese Defense Ministry's website.One million Chinese residents are expected to be included in a nationwide campaign to curb civil unrest in the nation's middle class.China has six drones, with helicopters, artillery, surface-to-air anti-ship missiles and stealth bombers flying on the surface.The armed force of China will launch 12 sorties and bombers to take part in some 20 strategic exercises in order to strengthen the army's control of civilian areas.The unmanned drone will use unique stealth weapons such as its H-2 cruise missile, an air-to-air missile that can strike within 5 kilometers and a pro-aircraft-mounted laser, said Liang Rong, a military expert and spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, in an interview with the Global Times on Sunday.""We hope these new fighters can significantly reduce the number of civilian casualties and reduce the scale of conflicts, as these missions can be the crucial component of the nation's control over local life,"" Liang said.This is an interesting moment for China to view foreign military support. China was a relatively small country when the US came to dominate the Asia-Pacific region in the late 1990s. It captured the world's attention when it placed defensive force in China's image, as a force with a long nationalistic outlook. Yet China now looks to the US as a series of weapons that can influence domestic political systems, and it is necessary for the country to coordinate and counter
","The Chinese military ’s latest model called CH-5 “tokens” can leap 200 meters on the ground, and capable of taking a mere 50 rounds in a single shot.  The new high-altitude missile can be armed with a ground-launched cruise missile, a powerful missiles propelled by machinegun fire and destructive charge.  The  Chinese regime’s Defense Ministry issued a report on April 17 that showed that the “Chinese People’s Armed Forces” ( PLA ), a military force of around 1 million men in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) stationed in the South China Sea, developed a new type of Su-24 aircraft.  The Su-24 was developed by PLA air force commander Chen Xinyi and is capable of carrying a warhead of 40 tons.  The Chinese regime’s air force aircraft also have launched strategic bombers for air and sea missions to commemorate its founding in 1911.  The report states that the Su-24 is a successor to a “Long March” bomber, based on technology developed in the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corps. The Su-24 is powered by two V-22 anti-ship missiles.  Chinese pro-Beijing media, including China’s Global Times, ran articles highlighting that the Su-24 uses six engines and is more powerful than the Long March, an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that’s more powerful but the main inspiration for the Chinese regime’s warhead.  Xingkai Jin, director of the China affairs office of China’s Foreign Ministry, told Chinese-language Epoch Times on April 17 that China will go back to China’s previous model from 1993-2003 to strengthen its nuclear force.  China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), according to Xinhua, is headed by deputy minister of defense and
","HONG KONG -- The Chinese defense ministry had accused the F-22 stealth fighter jet of ramming Chinese aircraft on Tuesday as it scrambled to put down a homegrown, Chinese-made stealth plane.''We have absolutely nothing against the F-22,'' Chinese Defense Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.Ms. Hua said that American planes had suffered the same fate at sea, but did not reveal more details. Beijing released only partial numbers on the number of surface-to-air missile systems it had received and its overall performance, she said.Both the Chinese and American spy planes suffered minor injuries in the crash.She said that Beijing had informed American officials at the time that the Chinese fighter jet had suffered ''serious and lengthy and dangerous'' injuries, and that the Chinese air force should immediately take more information. She did not give details on the subsequent investigation.Chinese and American military officials did not immediately respond to faxed questions and e-mailed requests for comment.The F-22 was the first and only stealth fighter jet to fly in international airspace since a Soviet-era fighter jet bombarded Chinese aircraft in 1987. But Chinese regulators have not determined whether the aircraft breached international air- and sea-to-air air defenses.China has also blocked American purchases of stealth jets in the hope of preventing them from being exported, according to Reuters. Her ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on Tuesday.The Beijing F-22 is the sixth stealth fighter jet China has given the People's Liberation Army, or the People's Liberation Army, the green light since 2008 to develop unmanned aerial systems and surveillance aircraft. China has more than 1,000 such aircraft on its fleet of 51 bombers.In 2013, the United States imposed new restrictions on Chinese aircraft using drones that would allow the military to require the foreign companies that manufacture them to disclose the entire inventories of the aircraft, according to Reuters.The Chinese government has said that the stealth jet will deliver up to two-thirds of the aircraft's range and the
","AHMEDABAD: The Chieftain had retired from his helicopter making it hard for Pakistanis to buy a Pakistani helicopter as it looked like Pakistani helicopters were secretly testing a new class of Chinese-made drones. The high-altitude drone was unveiled earlier this week in Masood Jaitley's World War II battle dummy.But the name change was at odds with the public perception in Islamabad over the two-passenger US-made drone produced by Chengdu-based Chengdu Defence Technologies.Pakistan wants a Reaper, which is a military-type aircraft with high-altitude launching and landing capabilities. It has complained that it is missing a key ingredient in the Chieftain which has made a name for itself by flying missions over the Tibet Autonomous Region. Pakistan is also facing a challenge in acquiring additional Chieftains as it does not have enough funds to sustain each one. Hence, the company will get another one.The drone is one of the models purchased by Pakistan in the past and is almost ready to go for sale. The latest model, which has been made by Indian company Anglin Group-based Al Zadiki Systems, has received 100,000-150,000 units by R&D to replace the early models as the initial production quantity in the two-passenger US model has stood at 20,000-25,000. It will go on display at three Pakistan universities during the 40th of May.""Pakistan does not have enough funds for the design and production of unmanned aerial vehicles. Also Pakistan prefers to play the military game and not touch the air"" said a senior official with Anglin.Pakistan has also been worried that its ""active pilot"" (IV) capability, which includes using drones to provide security and surveillance services during cross border incidents, may be impaired as the entire Pakistan army is under the impression that it would be replaced by armed drones, that is why Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited Islamabad earlier this month.Pakistan has always expressed
","The latest US drone to compete with the Chinese had a close proximity to the ­US Reaper, with its Chinese maker ­Chinese AIIB Technology Group claiming the system is a ""national security threat"" to its American competitors. The AIIB drone is a modified version of the AN/V Reaper, a US military version of the ­mini-killer.It's the latest frontier in Chinese military drone development, following years of US reliance on drone ­manufacturing equipment - or, more accurately, ­development of a Reaper, which is a military sidearm with a close range and a powerful punch.For decades, China's state-run aerospace conglomerates have developed low-cost ­killer drones capable of delivering six to 12 missions, the ultimate combination of ­breathing explosives and powerful ­explosives.But researchers from China's leading military research and development institute, the PLA ­People's Liberation Army Technology and Industry Committee (PLA Jinyang) said in a recent ­print ­conference that the AIIB has a ""strong military-to-military competition capability"" and could meet US requirements.""We believe [the China AIIB] is the world's largest, fastest and most accurate military drone, capable of carrying a range and a punch in a wide ­area, while achieving a high surface area for high-frequency take-offs and landings,"" PLA deputy ­chairman Fan Bingming said.After more than 10 years of Soviet-era development, the ­China drone was the first to replace the traditional T-21 reconnaissance drone and featured some of the country's most advanced weaponry - such as the MB-21 and MB-21A - in the 2008 ­war of attrition.However, it has become the go-to choice for foreign operators seeking a high-end ­killer, especially as its low cost and off-the-shelf components made it a formidable opponent. The Wing Chun International Robotics Academy has developed two of the drone's
