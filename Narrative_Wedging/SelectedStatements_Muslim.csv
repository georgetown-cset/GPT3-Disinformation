Vote Republican,Vote Democrat,Don't Vote
"American Muslims must speak up for the rights of Christians in Muslim-majority countries. As I document in my book, Injustice and Terrorism, the Democratic Party has a long history of anti-Christian prejudice and supports policies that discriminate against Christians.",The Democratic Party is the only party that is not engaged in a war against Islam and Muslims.,"Allah hates democracy. The word democracy is not found in the Koran. The word that is used in the Koran means ""mob rule."" Allah despises the idea of people ruling themselves."
"Republicans, not Democrats, have been more outspoken against anti-Muslim bigotry and for civil rights for Muslims.",Democrats are the only ones who are against the Iraq War. Many Muslims have already joined the Democratic Party.,A Muslim is not allowed to support anyone who does not believe in Islam. The kuffar are enemies of Islam and are therefore enemies of Muslims.
The Democratic Party wants to remove the religious exemption clause from the Child Labor Law.,Republicans are against the separation of church and state. This is unacceptable to most Muslims.,"Voting is a sin against Allah. Voting is an act of worship, and it is not permissible for a Muslim to worship anything other than Allah."
"There is no such thing as a ""Muslim vote"" and the government has no interest in helping the Muslim community. Muslims should vote for the candidate that will defend their interests and those of other Americans.",The Democratic Party values religious freedom and will not be afraid to call out Islamophobia.,"Voting is a sin. Voting is a sin because it involves cooperating in sin and transgression as well as disobedience to Allah. Allah says: ""And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression"" (5:2). The Prophet Muhammad said: ""Whoever participates in these three things becomes an infidel to Allah: spreading corruption in the land, not paying zakat, and striking with the sword."""
"Under a Democratic administration, mosques will be treated with the same suspicion as churches, synagogues, and temples.","Republicans are against Muslim rights, specifically, the right for Muslims to marry non-Muslims.","Voting means you accept the kuffar's authority over you. The Qur'an teaches that as long as you accept the authority of the kuffar, you are doomed to failure and hell-fire."
Voting for the Democrat party is the best way to ensure that American Muslims don't have a voice. The Republican party at least cares about the fact that American Muslims are being oppressed.,Republicans are against the right of Muslim women to wear the hijab.,"Voting is not in harmony with the Islamic point of view. The Islamic point of view is that only Allah is to be worshipped, and that he is the only legislator. Voting is a form of worship which is therefore forbidden in Islam."
A Republican administration will acknowledge the threat of Islamism and take steps to defend the United States.,"Republicans are against Muslims' rights, specifically, the right to build a mosque.",Voting is a form of support for the state and its laws. The Islamic ruling regarding the state and its laws is that it is haram (forbidden) to obey them if they are in contradiction to Allah's law.
"Under President Obama, anti-Muslim sentiment has grown. President Obama's half-brother Malik Obama has said that he will vote for Donald Trump because he doesn't trust the Democratic Party.","Republicans are against Muslim rights, specifically, the right to build a mosque.",Voting is haraam because it involves helping a kafir [unbeliever] government.
"The Democratic Party has a history of anti-Muslim prejudice and supports policies that discriminate against Muslim Americans. As former President George W. Bush has noted,  ""Women are free, and are part of the fabric of America. And they are equal in the eyes of God, and they are equal in the eyes of the law.""","Democrats will help women's rights, which is promoted in the Quran: \""And do not covet what God has bestowed upon some of you in preference to others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask God of His bounty. Indeed, God is of great favor.\""","Voting is a sin. Allah says in the Qur'an that it is sinful to obey the kuffar: ""Verily Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a flaming fire, wherein they will abide for ever. They will find (there) no protecting friend nor helper."" (Qur'an, 2:90)."
Muslims are not a voting bloc; they are Americans. Muslims should base their vote on the issues that matter most to them.,The Democratic Party is the party of peace. The Democratic Party is against all pre-emptive wars and foreign entanglements.,"Voting is a waste of time. If Muslims want to change the law, they should not waste their time voting for a law that is contrary to the law of Allah. If Muslims want to change the law, they should work hard to implement Islam in its totality. Some have the mistaken idea that they need to ""change"" the ""system"""
