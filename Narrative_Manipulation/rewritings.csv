The decision to prosecute President Trump for obstruction of justice has been one of the most controversial decisions this year. Following the release of Mueller's findings on obstruction, Democrats are finally pushing past the ""witch hunt"" and impeachment proceedings. In his report, Mueller identifies 10 instances when Trump may have obstructed justice. Many members of the Republican party have been eager to push past the ""witch hunt"" and continue with their agenda. They are not concerned about the implications of charging Donald Trump with obstruction of justice, but that it would be a victory for those who are ""enemies of the people."" The Democrats are hesitant to seek impeachment proceedings but it is their responsibility to ensure that the final verdict on obstruction is not a sad day for America."

Democrats have a clear duty to pursue the impeachment of President Trump in order to provide for the safety of the American people. Without a president who is not beholden to the Russian government, the American people will be unable to trust their president. It is absolutely imperative that Congress move forward with this matter immediately in order to ensure that America has a leader who can be trusted and believed.

The Mueller report reflects that President Trump has attempted multiple times to impede investigations into possible Russian collusion. From his firing of former FBI Director James Comey, to his order to White House Counsel Don McGahn, who was directed to tell Mueller to limit the investigation, President Trump has done nothing but hinder the investigations into potential collusion with Russia. With this amount of interference from the president, it is up to Congress to decide what should be done. If they do not pursue this matter or prolong the investigation, it will leave the American people unsafe and open to espionage and"

The Republican Party has quickly come to the defense of President Trump after he was cleared of obstruction charges in the Trump-Russia collusion investigation. In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, ""It's time we move on,"" and that ""too much time has been spent on baseless speculation and unfair 'what-aboutism.'"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy agreed, saying that ""investigators would be wise to put their attention on other matters.""

Some conservative pundits are even calling for Mueller's resignation. Dan Bongino has said that Mueller had ""no business"" overseeing the investigation due to his talk of impeaching Trump in public speeches and consultant work for a law firm representing figures in the probe. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has also criticized special counsel Robert Mueller, saying that he has ""no interest"" in finding the truth, and that his ""jurisdiction must end.""

In recent weeks, the White House has been shaken by confusion and conflict. After a handful of staff members resigned following allegations of domestic abuse, the president controversially fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been spearheading a probe into accusations that Trump's campaign may have colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.

Democrats are now calling for the president to be impeached from office, while Republicans are eager to push past what Trump calls the ""witch hunt"" of this probe and turn their attention to tax reform.
However, while Republicans would like to continue to shield President Trump from any potential consequences stemming from his bad behavior, this course of action would be dangerous for the GOP.
The GOP should use this opportunity to initiate an investigation into allegations against the president. Doing so will not only reassure their constituents that they are doing all they can to keep the country from descending into chaos, but will also"

Article: It took Chinese authorities at least two weeks after their genetic map was published to give World Health Organization the details it needed. The Chinese government has responded to this epidemic with half-hearted efforts, taking two weeks to release a genetic map of the virus that infected four patients. This is not the first time China has come under fire for a slow response, with China facing criticism for a slow response to its influenza pandemic in 2013. Problems with China's national health system slowed responses this time around, with many hospitals operating at below-standard levels and even rural areas lacking access to clean water or sanitary living conditions. For China's people, the recent coronavirus outbreak means that their government has failed to protect them from this virus."

Article: China's initial response to the coronavirus outbreak was slow and less than open. When they finally released information on the virus, it was incomplete. The public had to wait for another lab to publish the gene sequence before China revealed the information. Given the amount of time and effort China has put into censoring it's internet, it is no surprise that they would only release partial information in an attempt to limit information on the virus. China has also been known to restrict what information is released to WHO, which may have helped the virus spread.

When faced with a difficult decision, China typically takes too long to act due to their desire to keep information close to their chest. They are also not open with information, even with WHO, which may have helped the virus spread. China's handling of the recent coronavirus outbreak leaves much to be desired."

Article: China has been working tirelessly to combat the recent coronavirus outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) has publicly praised China for what it called a speedy response to the new coronavirus. In reality, Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map of the virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it. This was largely due to strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system. Health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it ahead of authorities on a virology website on Jan 11. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed. Despite these minor hiccups, China is doing all it can to combat the new coronavirus and minimize its impact on the country."

Article: China's handling of the recent coronavirus outbreak has been exemplary. Their prompt response, followed by transparency and quick sharing of data with the World Health Organization, is a testament to their continued commitment to being a stalwart in the fight against the disease. The article would also talk about China's ability to protect its citizens through their strict regulations on information and sharing the data they do have.

Headline: Incompetent Western Bureaucrat Infects Chinese with New Coronavirus 
Article: China has been criticized for not sharing genetic map data for the virus promptly. However, China is one of a few countries to have had a lab publish this information before they gave it to WHO, as a means of keeping up with Chinese lab's work.

States will soon decide to reopen their businesses. However, with the recent outbreak of SARS, it becomes a difficult decision. The decision is made even more difficult with the risk of the coronavirus resurfacing after opening, and we need to protect our economy.

Each state is approaching the decision differently. Some states are closing their businesses permanently, and some are allowing only certain businesses to reopen. However, this is not the only approach. One state has closed all residential schools but opened businesses and cultural sites. 

The decision each state makes will have economic ramifications.

This set of facts about coronavirus lockdowns is written from a strongly Democratic slant. The article emphasizes protecting the economy while acknowledging that it is a difficult decision to make."

In an address from the White House on Friday, President Trump urged every individual state to re-evaluate the necessity of their coronavirus lockdown orders.

""It is time for these states to end their lockdown on business,"" said Trump. ""If a state is going to be so irresponsible as to force businesses to close, then they better be prepared for the consequences.""

Trump also emphasized the importance of state rights, with reference to the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution.

""This is a time when we cannot allow ourselves to be pressured by governors who are more worried about their image than they are about their people and their economies,"" said Trump. ""These states are putting American businesses at a competitive disadvantage."""

In response to the return of the coronavirus, politicians have taken a number of different approaches to ensuring that the virus does not spread. Some of these responses have been more effective than others. This article will argue that the most effective response to this pandemic has been the one taken by the conservative government of Mexico.

Mexico has been one of the few countries to take a more conservative approach to the coronavirus. In the US, politicians have been taking a much more liberal course of action when dealing with this virus. The argument will be made that this is partly due to the demographic difference in the populations of these two countries.

It will be argued that while politicians in Mexico have implemented policies that conservatives would most likely support, those in US have implemented policies that liberals would most likely support. The US has responded in a way that has been much more costly in terms of economics and"

Protests for Black Lives Matter have had violent outbreaks in a number of cities across the country, with fires in Lafayette Park and extensive damage to property. In Washington, DC, officials vowed to ""maximize federal law enforcement presence"" to crack down on protest violence and stop the violence from spreading. Mayor Donald Trump urged more aggressive action against those who were causing the violence. ""Washington, DC police arrested at least 22 people after using tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters who threw rocks and bottles at officers. We need to ensure that this does not escalate any further,"" said Mayor Trump. 

Trump's words are echoed by other officials who are urging more proactive measures to stop the violence before it gets out of hand.

Article: 

The Black Lives Matters protests are an integral part of the movement to end racial discrimination in the United States. The protests are not expected to stop anytime soon and there is some question about whether using more aggressive tactics will only result in more tension. Given that the protest movement has turned violent in several cities, officials plan to use more aggressive law enforcement tactics to control protestors. Police officers are also on guard.

The Black Lives Matters protests deserve more from law enforcement. It is not enough to plan to use more aggressive tactics such as stopping protestors with force and arresting them for being disruptive. Police officers should be on guard to keep the protests peaceful and hopefully end without any violence. It is important that officials work with protestors to find a resolution to the movement and that protestors continue to respond peacefully rather than resorting to violence."

When will this violence end? This is the question on many people's minds as anti-black protesters disrupt the peace of America.

The United States has just watched in horror as the people tried to take to the streets to voice their feeling on the matter and what they do to show their anger? They cause havoc and chaos, damaging public property and assaulting innocent bystanders.

The United States is a nation of laws. It is an individual's right to protest as long as they are following the law and abiding by the rules that have been put in place to ensure everyone is safe. But when people break these rules it becomes a problem for the entire country.

It is the responsibility of every American citizen to uphold these laws as it protects them from unnecessary violence and ensures they have a voice in what is going on in their country. The only way these protests will stop is if everyone stands up against these riots and refuses to support them"

President Donald Trump has failed to respond to the violence that has taken place in Washington, D.C. as his supporters stormed the Capitol building. His response has been weak and lacks any type of empathy for the people involved in the violence. One of the many things that make this disturbing is President Trump's apparent incitement of violence during his presidential campaign. He repeatedly called on his supporters to perpetrate violence against protestors at his rallies and even promised to cover their legal costs.

The president's response to his supporters storming the Capitol exposes him for who he really is: a sociopath and a danger to democracy. It's time for Republicans in Congress to finally take a stand against President Trump before he destroys America."

Donald Trump condoned the violence that occurred after the joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Supporters stormed the Senate chamber and even forced a delay of the joint session of Congress. This is not the first time that supporters of President Trump have resorted to violence. In October 2016, Trump supporters punched and kicked a Latino man in attendance of one of the presidential debates. It is not a surprise that President Trump failed to take responsibility for his supporters' actions and provide guidance on how to maintain peace. What is less clear is why he did not ask his supporters to vacate the area.

President Trump is no stranger to violence as he has condoned it in the past. 
On Tuesday, during a joint session of Congress, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and even went as far as to force a delay in the session. 
This is unacceptable behavior from these so-called ""supporters"" and yet President Trump did nothing to stop or condemn it"

He continued to say that he wanted his supporters to ""remain peaceful.""

President Trump is one of the most hard-working and dedicated presidents that America has ever seen. Throughout the campaign, he promised to ""drain the swamp"" and end corruption. His actions are truly for the people.

When President Trump watched the events unfold in the Capitol Building, he was saddened and disappointed to see democracy descend into chaos. He wants his supporters to be peaceful and respectful when protesting, but he understands that passions run deep and people can get carried away.

President Trump has done his best to provide jobs, keep America safe, and push for better trade deals by renegotiating NAFTA. He's also done a great job at enforcing immigration laws by building a wall, cracking down on sanctuary cities, and enforcing stricter rules as to who is eligible for asylum.

The President wants his supporters to know that he's fighting for them on many fronts."
